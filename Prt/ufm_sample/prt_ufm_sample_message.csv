 We have not used gold in our portfolios due to our long term hold strategy 
 We have found that by rebalancing during tops and bottoms we can reduce risks and enhance returns while staying fully invested during downturns in the markets 
 This was also true during the difficult 2008/2009 period 
 I have found that it is extremely difficult both intellectually and emotionally to predict significant downturns and reversals 
 Since this is our case if we were to hold gold it would have an opportunity cost to our portfolio 
 If we were to hold a significant percentage in gold, say 20%, to make an impact to the portfolio this would have a significant carrying and opportunity cost to the portfolio 
 Gold pays no interest and is valued only by crisis mentality demands

   History will tell you that anytime there is a potential bubble forming, traditional valuation methods are much less effective at determining fair value sense the current divergence is driven by views of future potential growth, which can not be predicted with reasonable certainty 
 Negative earnings can be difficult to value similarly as the above examples 
 Technically they are worth $0, so you are paying for future growth (Amazon in US) and in return should demand a much better ROI. Side Note: trading negative cash-flow public companies may be done best by using technicals sense they are driven by emotion and many times the heard mentality

6803,981,344,4,2017-06-24 12:44:15,"That question brings the paramount of today's financial politics into reflexion, and I am happy to offer a tentative answer to it 
 First of all, the U.S 
 Government did not simply ""waste"" public's money with the bailouts 
 TARP program ended in a net profit for the U.S 
 Government, regrouping $441 billions out of $426 invested in a 6-years timespan 
 So the public's purse did not waste a single cent with this action, inflation accounted for. Secondly, this bailout was organised for systematically important banks only, and without so, the economy as a whole would have been put in great danger 
 Bailouts were not organised for poorly managed banks, but only those deemed at risk for the economy as a whole 
 These two points are very important to recall, because they just speak for themselves 
 It was a cost-efficient solution to respond to a highly risky situation 
 Believing that the ethical implications can outweigh the excellent solution, technically speaking, that the U.S 
 Government brought at that very time, does not seem reasonable to me 
 If it had to be done again, it surely should be the case 
 Now, picking up this side of the debate does not mean that the ethical implications should be completely offset 
 It is critical in my opinion to combine this view with a stricter approach on two dimensions 
 First, the U.S 
 Government should make sure to use the profits from TARP, minus inflation, to provide extra resources to forensic and investigative departments analysing the historical wrongdoers (in additional to their regular budget, as a sort of ""bonus"" cashflow) 
  Secondly, the implication of some key executive individuals at the systematically important institutions, is so sensitive to the wider economy and the society at large, that they should be subject to the same level of personal responsibility that judiciary, military or governmental personnel may have 
 That includes, to speak bluntly, criminal responsibility in some cases 
 As such, I strongly believe that the best answer to the current debate around public bailouts is to keep being supportive of them, to avoid at any cost a bigger crisis, while at the same time strengthening both investigative and retaliatory options against wrongdoers 
 Attempting to bear the cost on other (innocent) investors, or the public at large, does not seem to be the most ethical solution a society could wish for"

 Bailout is the right tool only in case there is no other option

 First of all, companies that looks the same and have more-less similar structure, can have different trends and different management 
 Like, company A is constantly growing during last 10 years, they have a stable high-level management team and want to introduce to market new product, and company B is falling down during last 5 years, they change management team 3 months ago, but still the capital and brand is quite power to have the same P/E 
 Or, for example, one of companies with the same P/E finally has an agreement with Chinese government and from the next year will work on this market, and the second company - does not have such 
 So, for now they both looks the same, but opportunities to growth and significantly increase earnings has only first 
 EBITDA rate is also not the best, because EBITDA is the earnings before, for example, amortization, and one of companies has new buildings and this costs is low for them, and other company, with the same EBITDA has 39-years old building of main factory and amortization for them will be more bigger, because of law restrictions to 40-years old buildings, for example

 Sure, if bank returns are low because of interest rates, investors including banks have to chase yield or higher returns

 Take the case of Wells Fargo in its efforts to boost earning being rather reckless in churning, cross selling and other devices to extract revenues and fees from clients

4977,2065,18,4,2016-02-22 05:30:03,"That assumption is that \nfirm is expected to be in high growth for the next n years and stable growth\nthereafter 
 A valuation multiple is simply an expression of market value of an asset relative to a key statistic that is assumed to relate to that value 
 You would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies when that statistic – whether earnings, cash flow or some other measure – does not bear a logical relationship to the market value observed, when it is not seen as the driver of that market value 
 A multiple is a distillation of a great deal of information into a single number or series of numbers 
 By combining many value drivers into a point estimate, multiples may make it difficult to disaggregate the effect of different drivers, such as growth, on value 
 The danger is that this encourages simplistic – and possibly erroneous – interpretation 
 A multiple represents a snapshot of where a firm is at a point in time, but fails to capture the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of business and competition 
 Multiples are primarily used to make comparisons of relative value 
 But comparing multiples is an exacting art form, because there are so many reasons that multiples can differ, not all of which relate to true differences in value 
 For example, different accounting policies can result in diverging multiples for otherwise identical operating businesses 
 The use of multiples only reveals patterns in relative values, not absolute values such as those obtained from discounted cash flow valuations 
 If the peer group as a whole is incorrectly valued (such as may happen during a stock market ""bubble"") then the resulting multiples will also be misvalued 
 Multiples are based on historic data or near-term forecasts 
 Valuations based on multiples will therefore fail to capture differences in projected performance over the longer term, and will have difficulty correctly valuing cyclical industries unless somewhat subjective normalization adjustments are made 
 Companies with losses (negative earnings) or no profit have an undefined P/E ratio (usually shown as ""not applicable"" or ""N/A""); sometimes, however, a negative P/E ratio may be shown 
 There are multiple versions of the P/E ratio, depending on whether earnings are projected or realized, and the type of earnings

 Where the government dropped the ball was to give the bankers complete freedom to do whatever they wanted with the 3.5 Trillion USD of the taxpayers money 
 This could have been avoided if a society had a control signal to modulate corruption between the politicians and the bankers 
 This is a signal similar to what the central banks use to modulate the economy, by controlling interest rates 
 This signal is called educating the masses of the white collar corruption that exists in practically all nations of the world 
 Ultimately a sound economic functioning of a society is the responsibility of its own citizens, thus a society should create adequate infrastructure, such that maximum transparency is created at all levels of the government 
 Once the people of a country realise that it is the very rich and the high powered government servants are the root cause of this economic meltdown, where millions of its citizens will suffer its bad consequences, then society as a whole will realise that in order to have a sustainable system in which even the crooked amongst us also do have a need to survive, then it becomes mandatory to mitigate corruption and not to exceed it beyond a certain threshold level for all of its citizens to live in moderate stability and safety of its societal structural systems, i.e 
 Political, legal, educational, commercial, etc. This is ultimately a problem of squarely looking at our own human nature, which at a fundamental level does not believe that honesty and honor has any place in today's economic market place, once people realise this flaw and take acceptable actions to change the values of a society, by raising our children not only think of themselves but also our neighbors well fare, till then even the courts will NOT be able to solve this problem, as we are witnessing in USA today

 Tech bubble where technology and telecoms firms became over valued 
 Using this approach, you would have likely calculated that a particular tech firm was approximately fair value, when in fact the sector as a whole was massively over valued 
 When there is a large amount of speculation in a particular sector about future growth, the results of this method should therefore be taken with caution 
 \nUsing negative earnings in this method gives a negative fair value, which is illogical given a firm has limited liabilities, thus can not loose an investor more than what they invest, making the minimum firm value zero 
 \n\n This method also assumes that revenues or EBITDA are representative of the overall performance of the business 
 There may be large one-off large costs (e.g 
 Restructuring, fines) or one-off sources of revenues (e.g 
 Sale of a division of the firm) which affect headline profits while underlying profits which is more representative of long-term outlook give a different picture of relative performance compared to its peers

 The example of Japan in the 90s shows that the bursting of a speculative bubble can compromise balance sheets of banks to such an extent that no lowered interest rate monetary policy is able to prevent the credit crunch and massive economic stagnation that ensues 
 On the other hand, as suggested by Niall Ferguson in his ""The great degeneration"" the lack of criminal/civil accountability of the people (managers) responsible for creating such a crisis is the real bad incentive for banks, as they profited millions during the bubble and did not have to suffer the consequences of their irresponsible management decisions (which were suffered by society as whole on their behalf)"

4679,2957,30,4,2016-10-03 12:26:45,"It was a bad incentive because: actions were not taken by the Federal reserve and the SEC  to properly stem the careless practices that led to the crises in the first place before bailing out the banks 
 Some of the practices include but is not limited to:  1)placing highly leveraged bets against the asset backed securities (mortgage backed Securities) they issued to uniformed investors just to make quick profit,  2) lack of control of the interest rates ( floating rates) on the mortgages given to individuals that barely had the resources to pay back the loans, so when the rates increased they defaulted on their repayments on their mortgages  the asset backed securities became worthless,  3) the bankers kept on marketing the already worthless securities to unsuspecting investors on the secondary market coupled with the fact that the rating agencies did not downgrade the ratings of those securities 
 Therefore the Federal Reserve used tax payers money to bail out banks that intentionally carried out careless practices that can be repeated in the future 
 The Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies should instead have increased regulation and monitoring of the banks before bailing them out to prevent a repeat of such carelessness on the part of the banks then bail them out to boost the economy"

 The denominator in the formula you provided discounts this Terminal Value back to its value today 
 So basically, Philip's formula gave you the (value of the) Terminal Value at the end of the of the explicit forecasting horizon (i.e 
 In the future) while the formula here gives you the (value of the) Terminal Value today 
 This is why in Philip's example of firm valuation, the Terminal Value (equal to 1742 in 2020) has to be discounted along with the free cash flow forecast in 2020 in order to get its value today 
 To summarize, the formula you provided here gives the present value of the Terminal Value 
 I hope this helps

 It does this by setting the cash rate to meet an agreed medium-term inflation target, working to maintain a strong financial system and efficient payments system, and issuing the nation's banknotes.""

 The GLD offers much more liquidity and fast return of cash to your portfolio, with little commission cost 
 Owning physical gold has a higher premium ($50 usd over spot price in some case) and it is harder to convert to cash 
 If the  global market was to crash, your physical gold will be worth more than the GLD etf because that runs with the index and a selloff will drag down the GLD eft, and lets not forget the financial institutions that backs those ETF. I don't think we will see such a global crisis which will make holding physical gold or ETF more valuable than owning stocks

 On Gold, I use it as long term insurance (LTI) 
  not as an investment 
 Both methods need a valuation Monetarily, Gold @ $1,181/oz and global supply at ~5.9 Billion oz 
 We have ~$7Trillion in gold 
 Well, if the  Global M1 money supply is $20Trillion & M2 is $48Trillion 
  The price of gold needs to increase 10X.  Possibility-perhaps 
 As we know from Accounting,  cash assets +  non-cash assets =liabilities +owners equity 
 So, increase one side and the other side must also go up 
 Any takers for either side 
 Let's use F&C's (Floors & Ceilings) 
  Take an exchange traded fund (ETF) like GLD and tract it for the highs (Ceilings) & lows (Floors) 
   As LTI.  one can   use F&C's over a long period of time (historical of course) and buy GLD near the low. Later when the price reaches an amount you are comfortable with (insurance wise) 
  sell it and put in in a safe place until you need it 
 As an investment, similar process 
 But here one needs to determine their Minimum acceptable Rate Of Return (MARR) + use F&C's to follow a trend that produces your MARR 
 This may be short or long term 
 Keep in mind that long term may be a very long time 
 So choose wisely 
 Now, if all you want is to get a market return 
 Then, why are you looking at GLD? just use SPY. This is an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 (an indicator of the Market) 
  They are both volatile but the SPY is more stable 
 Depending on your time horizon 
 One may be more advantageous than the other 
 Historical F&C's 1) 
  Buy  GLD in 2010  @ $100. Sell in 2012 @ $175 for a 32% CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) 
   2) 
   Buy  GLD in 2010  @ $100. Sell in Feb 2016 @ $114 for a 2% CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) 
  3) 
  Buy  GLD in Jan 2016 @ $105.  In Feb 2016 it is $114. This is 8.57%  Bottom line

 I don't feel that just because a company that reports negative earnings should be sold or ignored

2660,1990,218,4,2016-06-18 03:10:19,"It depends on your financial goals 
 Lets suppose you want to want to have significantly high returns from your investments 
 This means taking more risk in order to achieve your goal 
 Thus I would invest a large portion of the available capital in gold to use it as a back-up to mitigate potential losses from other investments so that I have capital to invest in the future to retrieve those losses, or at least a percentage of it 
 If you want to take a conservative approach, I would recommend holding from 15% to 20% of gold in your porfolio 
 Many may thing having a 20% in your porfolio is excessive, but during a ""black swan"", it can mitigate the losses substantially 
 In my opinion, better safe than sorry 
 Now let's suppose you want a porfolio with moderate return rates and risk 
 You aren't particularly interested in earning very high amounts of money from your investments 
 You prefer moderate/low returns with considerably low risk by holding, for example, a high percentage of AAA bonds in your porfolio 
 In this escenario, I would recommend holding from 10% to 15% of gold since you still need some kind of insurance 
 If you are a paranoid, though, and you are worried about possible economic downturns or ""black swans,"" you may want to hold 20% of gold, possibly more 
 During the financial global crisis we saw how CDOs, even the safest, lost their value and caused billionaire losses to banks and other financial institutions 
 Therefore gold, in case of recession, can back you up against it to a degree, so it is wise to have a big portion of your porfolio in gold in a situation like that 
 And as we saw in this week's lessons, it is better to invest in gold when the economy is stable and its price is relatively low because it's price will raise excessively during an economic downturn 
 Am I wrong 
 Please feel free to correct me if you think so 
 I'll very much appreciate your feedback"

 The glasses were supposed to represent coupon payments and the large bottle of water at the right was supposed to represent the principal payment for a bond 
 Then he lifted the plank and placed under it a thin piece of wood on which the plank (and cups of water and bottle of water) was balanced 
 The balance point was supposed to represented duration as opposed to maturity which was represented by the bottle (that is, principal payment) 
  The balance point was very close to the end of the plank near the bottle of water right after the fourth glass of water (and not near the center of the plank) 
  Then the instructor mentions ""when I first knew about bonds, I thought the duration was some kind of, I don't know, average maturity 
 Maybe 2.5 
 It's not. Well, let's see, maybe what works, what happens 
 Can you hold there

 And in Year 2, you make plus 50% on the same investment 
 Are you on the same foot, on the same level, in terms of your capital 
 ""  I don't understand how it calculations are done which are as follows: Lets define 'x' as what you would have needed to gain in Year 2  for you to have the same capital as you had at the end of Year 0 
 And suppose your portfolio was worth 1000$ at the end of year 0 
 Then, 500*(1+x) = 1000

    There are no right or wrong answers for such an above question 
 Importantly, is that we need a diversified portfolio 
 ""Probably even 7 or 8 assets, for you do not know what will happen on the earth""- King Solomon uttered these words in a time of relative peace and prosperity where gold was plentiful 
 The focus in life should not be on our assets, wealth, money etc  There are much more things worthwhile than these things, than to be always fixated on 'money' 
  So in short, be diversified in at least 7 or 8 asset classes 
 With perhaps gold as an asset class 
 Therefore, percentage wise should be between 5% to 14%

 Being of the economy as a whole 
 Banks and financial intermediaries are at the center of the economies in the West and need to be protected in order to ensure credit and growth

 In my view the main issue here is that this creates a peculiar form of capitalism, which is not pure and truth 
 In its pure form when mistakes are made they have a value which should be paid be the people, organisations responsible instead of being shouldered by the taxpayers around the world 
 This could be good incentive for people in positions of power to think twice and make sure that their policies reflect long-term stability rather than short-term opportunism Having said the above a general collapse is also a very scary proposition but I believe it would have being a healthier one in the long run"

 The mere fact that the crisis happened had enough impact on the society to prevent similar events happening in the future, at least the near one. Since the reputation of the banks has become really bad throughout couple of last years and I believe that they will not be willing to risk making this situation even more worse by jumping into risky investments 
 On the other hand, the investors, or any people who are more active in financial markets are more aware of what can happen and will act more cautiously, due to the current lack of trust toward banks and financial markets 
 All in all, I believe that everyone now has enough incentive to double check what other ones are doing
