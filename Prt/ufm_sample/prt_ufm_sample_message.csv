 Yes, no similar companies traded on stock exchange - nothing to compare with

 The outline is that they are willing to make their own assets more valuable which actually worth much much lower if we look at the actual value

 It was important in that moment of time as the economy required a much needed boost and buying the impaired assets of the bank was important 
 After this much needed first aid the Basel 3 norms were adopted which imposed a much stringent regulation on the bank in case of borrowing and lending 
 This was done in order to give a message of caution to the big banks 
 The bottomline is the bailout of the big banks by the central bank was indeed important and it surely impacted the world economy in a positive way after the aftermath of the crisis"

 Stamatis In my opinion this is the most interesting part of modern finance, and asset management not an straight set or rules but rules that must be used according to the environment in which they are applied

 Historically, I would like to point the period around  _domain_  bubble 
 During that period lot of  _domain_  companies were overvalued and using multiples for valuin companies would have resulted in unfair valuation of stocks 
 Same applies with the companies that have just reported loss, their business model would have been like that which expects to generate earnings after certain period and valuing them based on multiples would actually be not considering their prospective future performance and leads to undervaluation"

 The first is that the current ratio on the market is also the correct one, that is, that comparable companies are correctly valued 
 The other assumption is that our company will have the same development (growth, etc.) like its peers is it compared to 
 It is dangerous to use multiple-based valuation methods in overvalued markets (bubbles) and in volatile markets 
 For companies with negative earnings we can use other ratios, such as price per sales

 For example, the bailout of AIG and other systemic banks (known as too big to fail) in 2008 prevented extended panic in financial markets and the real economy as well 
 The TARP program also helped the US banks to be able to lend soon in order to boost economic recovery 
 However, future bailouts should be avoided because taxpayers' money should not be used to save large banks who have taken excessive risks 
 Macro-prudential tools, bank regulation and supervision would relieve the problem of excessive risk-taking and probably would not allow another financial crisis to prevail

1507,244,510,4,2017-07-21 05:41:56,"Dear Mr 
 Hoesli, You have mentioned that investments in RE are usually a good hedge from inflation 
 I would like to challenge this statements based on the data from recent RE price development in Russia 
 In Russia we recently faced a number of factors: international sanctions and oil price shock led to increased outflow of capital from Russia which resulted in increased demand for foreign currency and substantial devaluation of Russian ruble 
 Devaluation led to increased prices of imported products and to increased prices of domestic products as well, since domestic producers decided that they can increase prices and still remain competitive in comparison to imports 
 As a result, inflation in the country increased sharply 
 In such a situation it could be logical to assume that if someone invested in real estate in Russia before all these events, she could be ptotected from inflation 
 However, what we witnessed in RE market after those events is that due to all these factors the purchasing power of Russian citizens decreased, since their daily expenses increased, so their demand for RE investments decreased as well 
 Thus, not only the prices of RE assets have not been adjusted for devaluation, they fell even in RUR terms together with rental payments, which also fell 
 Thus, for example, owners of flats, which let them for rent, not only were unprotected from inflation, but were hit by it and their investments decreased in value 
 Here is a short article about the RE price movements in Russia:    So, it seems that when hedge is mostly needed during the time when inflation jumps, RE investments do not protect from it 
 Thank you in advance for your feedback 
 Kind regards, Ilya"

 For this to stand logically, then the companies that we compare our stock with must have approximately the same capital structure, returns on invested capital and expected growth rates 
 Also the P/E ratio is subject to distortions in differences of accounting rules-such as restructuring charges and write-offs- and capital structures between companies 
 So if the companies that we compare are of similar industry, similar volume and calculate their earnings in the same way the P/E ratio is indeed a good measure of valuation 
 However better measures of valuation for companies even with this criteria are enterprise-based ratios, which unlike the P/E ratio are independent of capital structures"

 You bring up a good question about leverage and borrowing costs 
 In regards to the interest rate on amounts you borrow, the example given by the instructor assumes no borrowing costs, however in the real world you do pay interest on capital 
 So, you are right that your returns would be decreased depending on the interest paid 
 These costs could be substantial, but as a proportion of total capital invested, might be a few percentage points or less 
 2 
 In regards to leverage in the example: even though you pay back the $100 you borrowed, you still have made $20 profit on your initial $100 investment which is 20% 
  Compared to not having leverage you would have made $10 on $100, which is 10% 
  Furthermore, in some financial markets and (more so for hedge funds), you can get leverage that is more than 2:1 
 For example you might get 20:1 or 100:1 
 This is where leverage takes on greater risk and reward 
 With 20:1 leverage your $100 now controls $2000 and making 10% of $2000 = $200 or $200 profit 
 In this example, you made $200 profit on a $100 investment with leverage and would have only made $10 without 
 As the instructor mentions, leverage can also amplify your losses 
 Hence, leverage-related financial crises"

 The share in the stock market reflects all the informations available; and the investor are driven by rational motivations 
 Nevertheless, plenty of time, investors are moved to sentimetal motivations that, in a way, just ignore the valuation analysis 
 In special in crisis times, meanly in emerging markets, contagions effects, as happened in 2008 with the global financial crises moves the international markets ignoring the valuation methods 
 Just to remember after the financial crises, a lot of economists and agents of the financial markets thought that some emerging markets economies would not be affect by the global financial crisis, because those economies had improved their fundamentals in the beggining of 2000s, and consequently had good multiple valutions indicators 
 To sum up, companies that just reported a loss, can have a positive interpretation by the market if thoses losses are less negative than the expected

  I would see those who are risk-averse as wanting higher gold holdings 
 Most investors are conscious of the old picture of ""the miser"", who hoards heaps of gold in his cellar and practically nothing else 
 Gold has all of the benefits explained by Prof 
 Girardin, and all of the draw-backs, not least illiquidity and high opportunity costs 
 There are different types of risk-aversion, from the moderate (which may be no more than common prudence) to the extreme, whereby the mere knowledge that invested funds may have lower returns than anticipated induces a state of lethargy 
 (This lethargy may be so severe as to cause complete avoidance of financial markets altogether, as these are built on risk.) For those who would ideally prefer no risk, but accept it as some sort of necessary evil, a larger than average allocation to gold in a portfolio might make them sleep easier at night 
 I imagine that a flock of black swans would have to land before gold would be entirely necessary 
 These would include a prolonged period of stock market weakness, a catastrophic and irreversible plunge in the value of ALL world currencies, not just the dollar, accompanied by rampant hyper-inflation 
 Indeed so bad would things have to become that the possibility of fiat currencies backed by gold would no longer be enough to restore confidence in money without its replacement by gold coinage 
 But should holdings of gold merely reflect risk aversion, with those not troubled by possibilities of a major calamity occurring holding little or no gold 
 My opinion is that it is only those with large gold holdings who would be able to react to periods of prolonged panic

  Price is dependent on the nature of the market (Bull or Bear market) 
   Companies that just reported a loss but did well in previous years will have a negative impact from this because P/E ratio only considers the immediate results of the company 
 It does not pay attention to that company's past performance which is unacceptable 
 It will give a wrong picture to the investors

 Before I studied this section, I would have said that TARP and other bailouts encouraged bad behavior from banks, and there's certainly evidence that this is true 
 On the other hand, I think it could be argued that not providing the support of TARP to banks could have had catastrophic results; maybe even making the Great Depression look mild in comparison 
 That said, I wonder if there is a more proactive approach to crises like this 
 For instance, wouldn't it have been easier (and better) to have had a little oversight and regulation to avoid the manipulations and terrible financial instruments that caused the crash in the first place, as opposed to trying to pick up all the pieces once we are stuck in that terrible place to trying to heat up the economy (noting that we've just learned this can be very hard to do)"

 Michel tells great cooking & Goldilox stories but are they necessary for the course to be successful 
 Thoughts 
 In Week 1, Ines & Olivier give a good review of basic concepts 
 The dialogue is very basic for me but for those new to the field it is quite instructive 
 There is also a glossary page for more info 
 Also in Week 1, the basic concepts in Investment Management files by Vanguard-UK & Aswath Damodaran are great resources and two of my favorites 
 Although, I am surprised that the prestigious GFRI would outsource these 
 Why not utilize your in-house talents 
 Michel's stories may fit well in this area 
 In week 2 Part 2-Philip gives a good review with examples on calculating NPV, WACC, & EV

7732,3855,386,0,2017-01-15 23:48:23,"What could that assumption be 
 Using definition of ""comparable firms"" 
  We suppose that the comparable firms have the same operating risk (from the same industry) and similar stage of development (expected growth rate) will have relevant (to multiples) price in the stock market 
 For P/E multiples we also suppose that the comparable firms have a similar financial structure (financial leverage) 
   Were there instances in history where you would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies 
 I am a software engineer (from financial technology company, by the way) and I can refer to an example of the Instant Messenger programs (Skype, Viber, Telegram, WhatsApp) 
  It is the same industry (IT) and the same sub-industry (end-user, IM), and there is just a little different stage of development 
 We have to exclude Skype (according to multiples) because it is older, but other IMs start in approximately same time 
 It is serious limitation of multiples method, because it is the same area and skype user experience (positive and negative) is very important for other IMs, and sometimes IMs make some steps to harvest skype auditory to own side 
 But because skype is the old company (and now is part of Microsoft), we must exclude it from our observation 
 Let us continue 
 We also must exclude Telegram, because it is own project of Pavel Durov (without external or angel investments) and we can not evaluate this project in any way.  Ok, exclude Skype and Telegram, and what do we see? The most important metric for IM is the user's auditory, it's about 1B for WatsApp and about 750M for Viber 
 Viber was sold for about $900M, while WhatsApp - about $19B (to facebook) What is the key difference 
 Why does the price differ in 19 times while user's auditory differs just about 25% 
  So, we should consider other background, such as relationship between companies 
 Facebook was in need of any IM, because IM is the important source of user's information (which is used in internet advertising) 
   Facebook considers the leaders of the local areas, and WU was (and is) the most popular messenger in Latin America 
 Finally facebook has a growth of user's auditory in Latin America because another FB-killer Orkut (popular in Latin America) has been died and there was a great concurrency between social networks (VK, FB, OK, MS) 
  Buying the WhatsApp Facebook has automatically received the auditory of Latin America, but note please it's important only for Facebook and as long as you have workable model of earnings from auditory (FB has) 
  As a result Facebook wanted a lot to receive WhatsApp and was ready to pay extraordinary $19B. It is the reason of 20-times difference between WhatsApp and Viber, and we can NOT explain this phenomena using multiples method 
 What about companies that just reported a loss (i.e 
 Negative earnings) 
   I think it depends on concrete industry, country and condition 
 In the some industries (such as oil & gas) negative earnings in the oil bear market is OK (according to sector risks) In financial sector area in Russia in 2014-2016 is the same thing (according to country risks)"

 Gold according to me reduce opportunity cost

 The  _domain_  bubble is a perfect example, in retrospect, of a time when multiple-based valuation methods were inappropriate 
 The technological sector of the market had become particularly severely overvalued due to investor sentiment being clouded by the euphoria of seemingly endless gains in any company purporting to be a ""ground floor opportunity"" in the emerging dot,com space 
 That said, the dot-com bubble was different from other historical irrational market overvaluations such as the Dutch Tulip bubble, in that the internet during the turn of the millennium was still quite a burgeoning technology of unknown potential thus making any projections of the valuation of otherwise seemingly viable companies especially difficult

2983,2183,12,4,2017-10-18 15:20:56,"No single valuation means has consistently proof to be a best predictor of intrinsic value 
 Too many factors/assumptions influencing proper valuation 
 DCF also has it flaw when used on companies with negative cashflow"
1630,1361,19,4,2016-04-24 23:58:05,"Banks are made up by people, like you and me 
 I believe that preventing further economic stress through programs like TARP is not a bad choice 
 It is, however, a bad choice not to prosecute the people that worked in banks and that went against the law and put the economy in such a dire position 
 This type of policy provides bad incentives to banks in particular and to society in general"
6938,1113,349,4,2016-05-21 09:32:19,"Just last week while reading the telegraph, I saw photos of the Queen on a visit to the Bank of England's massive gold vault 
 It looked fascinating and appealing, very shiny-dull metal, and I've got to say, my preferences for an increased amount of gold in my portfolio did increase by a marginal 400 bps after that day"
2732,2030,153,4,2016-03-09 13:56:07,"No risk no gain 
 So I will allocate maximum 25% of my asset to gold as there is the opportunity cost of holding gold and if I put all my money in gold then definitely I am significantly minimizing my chances of substantial appreciation potential of my investment"
3571,1725,20,4,2016-08-25 16:07:35,"Like many investments, it depends on your budget, objectives, time horizon and other factors 
 Some financial professionals recommend keeping 5% to 10% (some say more) of your investable assets in bullion and maintaining that percentage through regular rebalancing 
 It can make a difference in overall portfolio performance and protect the investor from a 'Black Swan' event 
 Also gold has an opportunity cost which means that if it was bought and the price went down then there would be an opportunity cost of not investing in other financial assets that could yield a higher return"
2272,1766,617,4,2016-02-14 15:03:58,""" if that yield is prone to rise, then it will hurt your investment in bonds."" This is like ""When the inflation rises bond prices get cheaper."" Why? Bond you already have have a certain yield 
 If NEWLY emitted bond has higher yield, the bond already emitted that you have should decrease in price to make them have the same yield as the newly emitted one"

 Especially in 2017, the opportunity cost of holding gold will be relatively high, due to the likely increase of interest rate"
202,194,15,4,2016-04-16 22:48:11,"We would be applying trends that apply to a general industry that maybe disproportionately leveraged by highly successful companies 
 So for instance if we look at a P/E ratio of the aerospace and defense industry as a hypothetical 10, we must understand that this 10 comprises of P/E ratios of Goliaths AND Davids 
 Airbus and Boeing will have a P/E closer to this 10 than a smaller company like Dassault Systemes for instance 
 I think I would have been very uncomfortable applying this method if I were investing in the real-estate and housing market during the Celtic Tiger years in the Republic of Ireland 
 As the market itself may have had a high P/E, each individual project was, in my opinion, highly unstable 
 As P/E is a snapshot of the value of the market, it could potentially overestimate the ability of company to bounce back from a loss in relatively healthy market 
 P/E will only become more accurately reflective of this company's ability to bounce back when several of their peers make similar losses in that period, thus lowering the P/E and reflecting the observed company's situation"
4397,2845,388,4,2018-06-04 21:35:36,"In our company we use DCF in almost all cases when valuating the operational business subsidiaries 
 Based on the strategic plan and the budgets a DCF is possible and according to my view the best way to find a company value or to defend your book value as shareholder 
 P/E ratios are the exception for valuating investments but used in case of start ups or early stage companies 
 There you have negative cash flows and DCF makes no sense 
 But P/E ratios should only be applied by companies of the same industry or sector at the same stage of development and with a similar financing structure 
 To find these data is not so easy and it can be quite misleading 
 Please have a look at the  _domain_  disaster at the beginning of 2000 where a many companies with negative cash flows were valued incredibly high until the whole thing collapsed"

5282,2611,181,4,2018-07-15 06:06:03,"What makes gold attractive is that, unlike fiat cash, gold has a strong negative correlation with the level of real interest rates 
 Gold isnât unique in this respect  inflation-indexed bonds tend to move the same way but itâs always good to diversify economic exposures across a range of assets 
 This makes it a good hedge for those times when your fiat cash earns less than what it used to in real interest, whether itâs because of financial repression, diminished growth prospects, the so-called 
 This suggests gold should have relatively small weight as a proportion of short-term liquid assets in a neutral portfolio , a relatively small part"
3239,2247,356,4,2016-07-16 07:13:57,"I suppose people at or near retirement should hold more gold in their portfolio

6635,3313,192,4,2016-08-24 15:12:29,"From what I've learned and seen, it seems like the bailout of the financial sector was good for the economy as a whole 
 That being said, in terms of banks being careless in their investment activity, stricter policy that would curb this behavior could be a potential solution to keep the same mistakes from happening again"

4033,2693,24,4,2016-04-11 17:30:12,"I believe the bailout was necessary to avoid another great recession, whose impact will be so devastating with multiplier effect around the world 
 However, there should also have been consequences for the bankers and industry players whose roles contributed to the economic recession due to their greed 
 This would have serve as a deterrent for bankers to avoid similar situation in the future"
4767,2768,19,4,2016-05-02 03:54:58,"This issue can be considered threatening to the global economy as a matter of public concern, as we move away from the subprime crisis people may think that once the US government bail the banks out to avoid the collapsing of the entire financial system, this easily could happen again in case something goes wrong accepting the fact that some things are just too big to fail"
1581,1323,97,4,2016-07-25 16:18:20,"It depends on investors profile, if the investor is conservative he/she should probably maintain a large portion of portfolio invested in gold whether someone who wants to have higher returns and understands higher risk related to that should only have small portion invested in gold"

6722,368,18,4,2016-02-15 16:44:39,"Trailing P/E is using past data and does not reflect what the future holds for the company in question nor other similar companies 
 P/E is meaningless for negative earnings cases 
 Also companies may use different definitions in defining their earnings i.e some may include or exclude specific future cost items in their earnings statement"
4314,2106,15,4,2016-04-04 14:34:26,"Because usually we will find a good and similiar PE ratio for making the valuation

   For example, in the early '90, the first internet-linked firm went public: in that case, you couldn't use this method of valuation cause there were no similar firm like the ones you want to evaluate"
6630,2195,19,4,2016-04-30 11:52:06,"The bailout was a necessary evil: banks had a long run of continual inconsequential mismanagement, misappropriation even, that culminated in eminent collapse of the world economy, without the bailout we would have been back in a 1930's era- you can take that to the bank (pun intended) 
  Unfortunately, it sets up a false sense of security that if the banks mess up no one will suffer which is entirely wrong 
 One can only hope that there are better checks and balances, scrutiny, and transparency now in place to prevent a repeat"
2600,1953,292,4,2016-06-22 06:24:52,"I believe that bailout that US government's bailout was a necessary and at the same time risky creative decision 
 Definitely, it might not work in the future, but for now it seemed like a right choice to do 
 However, it is important to be careful with the same strategy in the future and probably develop set of rules for the financial sector in order not to cause potential disaster"
6498,2481,97,4,2016-07-28 08:47:37,"I would prefer a relatively small percentage of my portfolio in Gold because when black swan events occur and stock markets crash, its usually for a short period of time 
 Markets tend to recover relatively quickly 
 However, i beleive this is a subjective question in that it depends on the risk appetite of the individual investor, their age, goals, personal circumstances etc 
 So if an investor is close to retirement age, they should probably have a greater proportion / percentage of their portfolio in Gold compared to a younger person who would have more time to wait for his portfolio to recover in the event of a black swan /stock market crash or hyper inflation."

 It seems globally the investors have very well but the businesses did not do so well 
 Also it appears that a salary and wages at a certain level have not changed much whereas at the same time, the business owners / investors have done very well and accumulated wealth 
 In the wider interest of the Economy, bail is necessary as otherwise the economy would further suffer but at the same time the financial sector should be made responsible for its actions and not allowed to get away easily"

 This approach does not factor in crucial details such as company leadership, direct competition by another company or product superiority/inferiority 
 In addition, bubble economies, such as the dot-com bubble, will inflate the multiples across the whole market and thus skew valuation for all stocks in the bubble 
 In case of negative earnings, multiples are ill-defined and thus cannot be used 
 This also applies to start-ups, where no earnings have been reported because the product is still in development"

3804,917,619,4,2018-09-14 05:14:18,"Purchasing of Assests and Equity from Financial Institutions are necessary at that point of time to bring the US economy back to track 
 CB could use other tools to ensure banks from following careless investment activity"
6127,1695,294,4,2016-09-05 18:50:24,"We assume that similar companies will behave in the same fashion over time; however, there is a high probability that that may not be the case 
 There are many variables that, at any time, may impact current and future results 
 Additionally,  the effects of management activities and regulatory actions may not be clearly revealed in the shortterm 
 Yes, there were instances in history where I would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based methods 
 For example, during periods of irrational exuberance, we tend to see valuations trending toward the high end of the market 
 This may also be true when there are new industries or major innovators in a maturing market 
 With companies just reporting a loss, valuation may require additional time to adjust"
4866,2971,178,4,2016-05-22 19:00:59,"The bailout would not have required if the Regulators for Financial sector have had exercised adequate control and supervision over the financial sector 
 For instance, the subprime crisis was mainly caused by bank mortgages to property buyers were not secured by good value asset and many banks did not perform appropriate checks on credit rating of the borrower 
 Why did the regulators allowed such practices 
 The bailout is no doubt a bad incentive to the financial sector hence more rigorous regulation should be in place to avoid malpractice"
2913,648,22,4,2016-02-24 10:32:31,"Personally, I will never sell everything else and just buy gold; but to totally ignore gold as an investment is, I believe, no longer prudent 
 As with any investment, I will not choose an entry point near a peak, but gold is not at a peak right now. The whole idea behind an investment portfolio is that you canât know what the best investment will be for the future, so you pick a half-dozen or so of them in the belief that some will shine when others stall 
 Gold, I believe, should be one of those elements in everyoneâs portfolio and The reason is that the shiny metal has returns that aren't correlated with either stocks or bonds 
 So, gold does offer a diversification benefit"
1574,1317,323,4,2018-07-05 16:19:54,"By using earnings multiples of other companies to arrive at a fair value of the client company, we assume that the other companies' earnings have been fairly determined; that the structure of income and expenses in the client company is the same as in the comparable companies; and that the business sector, industries, regulatory environment, and management capability are the same in all companies 
 If one were to use the earnings of Enron, Inc., Parmalat, Waste Management, Lehman Brothers, or Norther Rock before the companies went belly up as the basis of a client company valuation, one would have be seriously wrong"

5965,3418,124,4,2016-08-21 12:13:27,"I could agree to some extent with your view, but I would like to point out two ideas: First is that, in that case, there should exist no Federal Deposit Insurance 
 Since this could have implied a lot of bankruptcies and bank liquidations, a huge amount of people, professional investors, and companies would have lost all their money 
 It goes against economy development and against trust that support all the financial system 
 My second point is that the financial sector is not another sector, but it is, in my opinion, like the arteries and the veins of the economy, since this sector conducts the blood (money supply) through the entire system 
 Therefore, I think that some special care have to be done to this vital function in the economy 
 However, I agree with the idea that responsibilities should be asked for somehow, so the public money would not be free for the banks"
5246,2693,15,4,2016-04-01 07:26:02,"They have to have similar growth rate and financial risk 
 I would not have been comfortable using the multiple-based valuation for internet based companies during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s 
 For companies that reported a loss it will not be a good idea to use multiple-based valuation if the reason for the loss making is not general to other companies operating in the same industry"
5855,849,116,4,2016-06-19 07:25:34,"The choice of the ""comparable"" company is important i.e., we need to pick up companies that are ideally within the same industry and positioned in the same part of the production cycle 
 The companies need to come with a similar risk profile as well 
 The dot com bubble in 2001 and the sub prime crisis of 2008 reveals that there are times when the market can significantly overvalue the stocks of companies, much beyond the true fundamental value 
 The use of ratios during such times can provide distorted equity valuations"
98,96,82,4,2016-09-16 04:02:12,"Although the bailout was  necessary to pump in money in the economy , banks must be held accountable for the chaos they created  
  With interest kept low as 0, it gave banks the opportunities to enornomously expand making them to big to fail 
 Such a bailout does reflects leaniency"

8717,1830,151,2,2016-10-07 18:29:53,"An insurance should not take large part of a portfolio 
 Betting on the unlikely thing to happen is not a good strategy 
 So I would invest only a small part of my asset on gold"
5295,3177,8,4,2016-10-10 07:14:59,"Holding gold means a opportunity cost, but invest gold is a high insurance investment, so i would invest 50% of gold and 50% of other portfolio like equities and bonds"
6470,3566,34,4,2016-03-18 17:55:14,"I think it's necessary 
 There might be potential consequences of this bailout, but comparing with the potential consequence of NOT bailout,  I think the US government has just chosen the ""less bad"" side"
1863,1515,44,4,2016-04-14 20:46:33,"When you are taking these multiple assumptions, you have to assume the market is efficient 
 There are also a lot of underlying assumptions you must accept as true, such as companies in comparable situations will grow as comparable rates 
 I am not positive that this is a invalid assumption, but it is the first thing that jumps out at me"
6961,122,340,4,2018-08-26 12:29:54,It was necessary at this time in order to recover from the subprime crisis as fast as possible
2113,1668,341,4,2018-08-05 13:33:29,"In my oppinion I consider to have  between 20% to 30% invested in gold un my portfolio, but the right answer, thats depend of the political situation of the goverment in my country 
 The loss is the cost of opportunity, because the world is changing very fast, in short time the things can be change  dramatically and ""new gold"", like ""the knowledge"", ""new technology"" could be appear"
4668,2952,242,4,2017-03-27 04:02:29,"I will keep the portion of gold in my portfolio quite small because I aim for higher return than gold 
 There are other investment alternatives that have higher return but at the same time higher risk 
 For the purpose of hedging against Black swan or other highly unpredictable events, I would rather choose option investment because of more various strategies that it allows me to use"
3316,625,393,4,2018-08-30 13:26:35,"This strategy was applied by the US government after one main financial event: Lehman Brothers went out of business 
 This means that the other major players took into account this potential bankruptcy for themselves in the future, as they are obviously linked to that 
 The lessons from the competition are more valuable than the government's policy 
 The bad incentive would be to be proactive and save Lehman Brothers, a financial institution that applied bad economic strategy 
 It seems like an oxymoron but it worked and it worked behavioralwise 
 The same happens in England after the collapse of Carillion in the construction industry 
 All the major players of the industry re-evaluated their strategy 
 At the past they were targeting big revenues and cash flows which made them compete for large jobs with lower margins and bigger risks which generated projects with substantial losses, while now they are targeting higher margins which makes the risks manageable even if the revenues are not that high 
 On the other hand, back in 2006 and when the Greek banks had many untrustworthy clients with unmanageable credit, the Greek government decided to re-capitalise them with 28 Billion Euros 
 This was a highly bad incentive and almost forgotten by the people 
 And at the end a totally bad decision as the monetary policy in Greece is driven by the European Central Bank which doesn't take into account the functional problems of such a small economy 
 As a result, some years ago the problem became bigger"

3697,1703,355,4,2018-05-14 14:05:36,"As we have seen from the above videos that gold is the oldest ways to store wealth dating back to 1400 BC by the egyptians 
 It has been used as investment, store of value, etc. Economies were backed by the gold reserves, which was considered the main reason for the great depression 
 However, it can provide a hedge against political tensions, inflation and collapsing stock markets 
 As I am from India and here people invest in gold for future use in marriages and other important events 
 I would  allocate 20% of my portfolio in gold as it would provide a good hedge against inflation and for a stable anchor in times of adverse stock market conditions"
3766,614,24,4,2016-04-16 22:48:11,"I think that the bail out relieves economies from financial crises and put them growing because what really happens in a bail out is the readjustment of the imbalances the crises create 
 To create the required balance, the central banks have to bail out the ""fountains"" families and and banks need to move the economy"
8361,416,157,2,2017-03-19 10:38:46,"I think it important to have a small share of your assets in gold 
 The reason is that, as the course had shown us, the prices of gold are quite volatile 
 Only a small fraction would be enough to protect you"
1498,1259,7,4,2016-03-20 16:11:35,"Besides of finding companies with similar operational risks and expected growth rates, the companies found should have similar history of earnings (sequence of profits and losses over valuated time period) 
  There are many approaches how to measure similarity of two sequences of numbers"
8115,3505,55,0,2016-02-22 00:23:23,"Question 5 is simple asking for the net present value 
 You have the benefit as 43 and the cost as 35 a simple subtraction of the cost from the benefit will give you 8

4635,2937,143,4,2018-02-18 19:38:51,I am worried about the potential consequences of this bailout in terms of bad incentives for banks
4232,114,35,4,2016-10-21 17:26:47,"Stock value multiples are influenced by leverage 
 For example, highly levered firms generally have higher P/E multiples because their expected returns on equity are higher 
 Also, the multiples are a snapshot in a point in the time and it has not in account growth and futuro cash flow

 Banks are fundamental to the financial system as well as the economy 
 Their business largely depends on the trust of investors and depositors 
 Thus, in times of financial turbulence, if the depositors lose trust and believe a bank is on the verge of bankruptcy, the risk of a potential bank run is high 
 Also it could lead to mistrust among the banks and the interbank financial system could freeze as we see in the 2008/09 crisis 
 A freeze will raise serious problems for banks since a main function of a bank is to transform short term debt to long term credit 
 This maturity transformation could be seriously impaired in times of soaring or even unavailable interbank lending 
 In short, even though there are compelling arguments for NOT bailing out banks, e.g 
 The belief of ""too-big-too-fail"" could generate high incentive for banks to be careless in future and give out more subprime loans, I believe it is necessary for government to give guarantees to potentially failing banks in order to ensure the trust of depositors and investors, as well as to prevent large spillover of the damage from one bank to others"

 The people arguing that in doing so the government might have incentivise the banks to issue bad loans simply neglect the fact that even in the absence of such bailouts the probability of bad asset/loan has been non zero 
 So, in my view the entire argument about TARP being an irrational move is a rather misplaced one, since it unduly overweights the probability that the banks will continue to give more bad loans 
 On a more careful note, I do believe that a more thorough study needs to be carried out which actually starts looking into the percentage of under performing loans/assets in the aftermath of TARP

 As touched upon by the UBS guest lecturer, inequality has risen in each of these geographical areas 
 I don't think it is any surprise that there has been a vicious lurch to the right as a result; US is suffering from a nationalism unseen there in over 150 years; English nationalism reached its nadir with the ill thought out vote to leave the European Union; elections in Greece, Germany, Austria and France have all seen increased support for fascist parties 
 The US central bank has seen more success that it's European counterparts 
 It is inconceivable that UK and European governments are so weak that they could not have imposed restrictions upon businesses, forcing them to lend where appropriate 
 Quantitive Easing saw eye watering amounts of money transferred to banks, to increase their liquidity, thus allowing them to lend more freely 
 However they did not. This policy turned out to be nothing more than a bonus to the banks for causing the biggest financial crisis since 1929 
 In my view, more banks should have been left to fail, as a stark warning of the consequences of failing to manage banking activities

5305,525,425,4,2018-06-26 08:40:48,"Stock investing requires careful analysis of financial data to find out the company's true worth 
 This is generally done by examining the company's profit and loss account, balance sheet and cash flow statement 
 This can be time-consuming and cumbersome 
 An easier way to find out about a company's performance is to look at its financial ratios 
 Though this is not a foolproof method, it is a good way to run a fast check on a company's health 
 For instance, a high PE indicates that the stock is either overvalued (with respect to history and/or peers) or the company's earnings are expected to grow at a fast pace 
 But one must keep in mind that companies can boost their P/E ratio by adding debt (thereby constricting equity capital) 
  Also, as future earnings estimates are subjective, it's better to use past earnings for calculating P/E ratios 
 So you need to find out the causes of the negative earnings of a company 
 The starting point in forecasting the cash flows of a company is to understand how the sales, costs, profits and cash flows of a company would develop over a long period of time, So you need to understand what are the key drivers for the company's sales 
 Those could be innovation, trends in consumption, consumers's taste 
 The costs can be influenced by the cost of raw materials, the cost of labor 
 You also need to understand how the company sit within the competitive environment, because the consumers have multiple choices 
 The quality of management and their decisions influence the company's performance 
 So, you need to take those factors together to establish the fair value of the company and to understand the short term dynamics of equities before investing in equities"

 In this regard, since full understanding of each company's operational activities, financial scores and market results is virtually impossible, one has to make certain assumptions to fill in knowledge gaps among similar firms' performance factors, or even offer generalizations just in order to force-compare firms along specific business dimensions

 Tech bubble where technology and telecoms firms became over valued

 When there is a large amount of speculation in a particular sector about future growth, the results of this method should therefore be taken with caution 
 \nUsing negative earnings in this method gives a negative fair value, which is illogical given a firm has limited liabilities, thus can not loose an investor more than what they invest, making the minimum firm value zero 
 \n\n This method also assumes that revenues or EBITDA are representative of the overall performance of the business 
 There may be large one-off large costs (e.g 
 Restructuring, fines) or one-off sources of revenues (e.g 
 Sale of a division of the firm) which affect headline profits while underlying profits which is more representative of long-term outlook give a different picture of relative performance compared to its peers

 When it is moved a fraction of an inch, you view an entirely different galaxy, and it is the same for the DCF method for valuing companies, different assumptions which may only vary slightly have a dramatic effect in determining the fair value of the company

Also due to me having a diversified portfolio not just in gold but in property, cash, stock, and  bonds, this would mean i have more of a chance of losing less as the problems within each market may not be as bad as the other 
 I also believe that confining most of my money in gold would mean that i am holding myself back as stock market crashes are happening on average every 3-5 years and right now were pushing 8-9 years and still no market crash, telling me that if i did invest in gold within a large part of my portfolio i would of wasted 8-9 years of potentially higher returns through other assets which i could of invested in 
 For all we know the economies around the world my be maturing more and the risks of market problems may slowly becoming less riskier meaning gold won't be of much value as it once use to be within our portfolio

 So, I concentrated on content not the assignments 
 Looks like the content has changed 
 Now, there is a quiz for week 1 and pop quiz during the video lectures in addition to the ungraded quiz in week 4 (which s the only one I knew of) 
  The course is coming together 
 Yes, I did not answer in USD Millions 
 I prefer to look at all the numbers and without a ""B"" or ""M"" they can be confusing On V0-This is the EV (Enterprise Value) 
   VN was given and I am pondering why FCFN would be equal to FCFt+3 
 No mention of ""t"" was given on the 6B VN for Q2 
 So, if I change the VN, What else has changed to get this 
 The info you posted ""I think?"" is from my answer in Q5 part 2 (but incomplete) 
  Are you asking about something else 
 Your p/share is lower by price than mine but what is the value 
 This is what I generally use for valuing an exchange listed firm (obviously, this is very different from WACC & EV) 
   Calculating the sticker price and Margin Of Safety (MOS) 1 
 Use the current EPS-TTM (Trailing 12 Months) 2 
 Select a growth rate (analysts, historical BVPS, or your own) 3 
 Obtain Future EPS by Growing EPS for 10 years (use calculator or rule of 72) 4 
 Determine future P/E (Price/Earnings) multiple (2x the growth rate from #2 or double historical P/E-conservative) Maximum of 50 5 
 Multiply future EPS and future P/E to get future sticker price 6 
 Default MARR (Minimal Accepted Rate of Return) is 15% 7 
 Discount future sticker price by MARR 
 Then divide by 4 =sticker price 8 
 MOS is 50% 9 
 Multiply the sticker price by 50% (MOS) = MOS price 10 
 Determine current market price 11 
 Is stock available under MOS price

4477,2516,80,4,2016-07-22 00:33:29,"To answer the undirbÃºning question ""why not always use multiple-bases valuation methods?"" We do so assuming all micro economical factors between the two companies are the same (I.e 
 Financial structure, growth stage and industry risks) but what we do not take into account are the Who What and How which might make one company more valuable than the other one which won't be reflected by the stock prices immediately 
 The assumption we make when we use ratios is that they are mutually competitive and will have similar performance in the market 
 A perfect example of when a multiple based valuation method would have been a bad idea is during the  _domain_  bubble 
 By comparing with similar companies would have lead to incorrect forecasts and ultimately overvaluation of a given company 
 If a company just reported a loss their P/E ratio may not reflect the actual valuation of the company for example if that company experiences seasonal sales/revenue boosts 
 Their P/E ration in Q2 might be quite high compared to Q4 where it will drop significantly due to earning reports"

I would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods during the creation of a stock market bubble when the whole set of companies and, therefore, the multiple become misvaluated 
 If a company has reported a loss its price-to-earnings multiple becomes negative and substantially meaningless

 The government revenus come from-inter alia- taxation and the citizens of many countries were thus penalised twice due to the careless speculation of certain wealthy individuals, who through these bail-outs recovered what in fact they deserved to have lost and the common citizen had to pay through a levy of taxes or unfair use of their contributions for State functioning

 That way if the assets are turn out to be no good, it was double checked by both lenders 
 Another mechanism I think should've taken place with TARP is an agreement that the banks would gradually receive a portion of their non-performing loans back 
 This way the poor choices still have consequences but the immediate relief needed to safety net the economy would still be there

 Of course even at those times having some gold wouldn't hurt 
 Other types of assets are apparently also to certain extent hedge each other against extreme events, for example cache hedges against stock market crashes, and stock market hedges against inflation 
 It's also not exactly free to keep gold once it's obtained, and buying and selling it might be subject to fees and taxes

 Those were exceptional circumstances when there was a terrible meltdown everywhere in US economy in particular and world at large 
 The real focus was on economy and any medicine, even if steroids, that would work and not on creating precedents and right incentives 
 Taking actions and creating incentives are actually 2 different things that should be viewed with different lenses 
 On the incentive and precedent part, we should punish those whose decisions might have resulted in the current circumstances, an elaborate inquiry, proper judicial scrutiny and adequate punishments for the  accused 
 In addition, the loopholes that are found from these investigations could be properly filled by appropriate legislation 
 In conclusion, under the crisis it is important to handle the situation at hand and try to resolve it in the soundest possible means, than waiting and doing nothing under the garb of principles and let the crisis engulf and decimate the investor confidence and in turn bring down the system 
 I am also, strongly against any intervention of central banks in the regular functioning of the banking system apart from the laid down rules as per the constitution or law. As a regulator the core, implicit principles are to ensure fair competition and also to intervene with full power in a situation of crisis and not sit back as sitting ducks"

If you're already rich and have no need to make more money in order to increase your quality of life, there is really no need to invest heavily in equities/bonds as you can simply keep a large stash  (80%) in gold while the 20% invested in stockes rakes in the cash (simply due to the volume in discussion )

 But the real question goes back to how the economy ended up in that situation 
 Strategic decisions were made along the way that implemented monetary lending policies that took the economy on a downward spiral without a lot of warning signals 
 As the saying goes, ""Prevention is always better than Cure"", the recession caused by unregulated monetary policies without sufficient warning signs could have been avoided or recovered earlier with appropriate regulation and warnings"

 People sometimes feel they're not being treated fair with such decisions, because the cost for such a bailout is provided through their hard-earned paid tax money, and the government appears lenient on the banks' catastrophic mistakes 
 Still, we have to see the above in perspective with the crisis consequences during the following years (and even the present) and imagine how worse things would have been had the government not intervened 
 Seeing that the US has the greatest financial sector worldwide, avoiding such a move would complicate things even more around the globe 
 On the other hand, even though there are many points for the bad incentives a bank might have, I think the banks and other financial institutions have also learned their lesson and wouldn't dream of repeating the same mistakes 
 Still, some regulation to avoid similar scenarios should definitely exist and governments should be cautious too.\n"

 According to the\nstudy of Ran Duchin and Denis Sosyura, banks initiate investing in riskier\nprojects, knowing they have been permitted for the government help if crisis\nhits 
 At the same time, not all banks have received bailout funds 
 Some of them\nwere only approved to receive it 
 These banks also began making risky decisions\nwith the aim to finally receive funds 
 However, large financial institutions\nare âtoo big to failâ 
  And even many economists find bailout funding less beneficial\nfor economy and considerably exceeding the announced costs, âpolicy makers and the public are essentially\nheld hostage by financial institutionsâ (Slavov, 2013)

 Taking this into account, I think the DCF valuation still has its place considering it is based only on numbers and statistics 
 One ought to stay conservative with its forecast of growth for it to make sense though 
 So any of the 2 options should be part of the evaluation overall, incorporating a part of statistical valuation as well as market perception, because there is a reason why a share is traded at a certain price at a given time, even if a mathematical valuation proves it should be so"
