Between 1980 and\\n1995, global capital flows have fluctuated between two and six percent of world\\ngross domestic product (GDP) \n  This sharply grew to 14.8 percent of world GDP by\\n2006 \n Moreover,\\nannual global capital flows tripled between 1995 and 2006 to a total US$7.2\\ntrillion \n The rapid transformation of the financial sector to a key driver in\\nglobalization can basically be traced back to three crucial changes during the\\n1960s and 1970s \n Firstly,\\nthe emergence of a Eurocurrency market in the 1960s, in which the first\\ninternational financial system was developed in which banks were dealing in\\nforeign currency \n The system supported cross-border transactions and avoided\\ndomestic regulations for Transnational Corporations (TNCs) due the fact they\\ndeposited their surplus funds in foreign currency, thus increasing the need for\\nfinancial service activity \n This has slowly softened under the Bretton Woods\\nSystem (BWS), which was established to return security to national economic\\nmarkets after years of high insecurity and low worldwide trade and investment\\nduring the two World Wars \n The\\nBWS collapsed in 1973 when President Nixon questioned the pegging of the dollar\\nto the gold reserves \n Secondly, declining international confidence in the US\\ndollar established a system where currency exchange rates were determined by\\ntheir value on the global market \n This established a foreign currency trading\\nmarket, which is the largest financial market in the world \n Currencies can be\\nsimultaneously traded in a 24-hours market completely electronically.\\nTherefore, thirdly, new technological innovations became a catalyst in the\\nemergence of the huge electronic financial transactions that have contributed\\nto the staggering evolution of the financial industry \n The annual turnover in\\nforeign exchange was US$17.5 trillion in 1979, increasing to a daily level of\\nUS$3.5 trillion or US$1,277.5 trillion annually in 2007 \n One\\nadditional aspect was crucial in the globalization process and rise of the\\nfinancial sector \n When the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)\\nquadrupled the price of oil, most banks were faced by a dramatic surplus of\\ncapital flows \n Moreover, nations became more dependent on banking institutions\\nwhen OPEC members decided to channel the majority of their earnings ―through\\nthe transnational banks \n Within four years, between 1976 and 1980, the major\\ninternational banks experienced a staggering increase of 95 percent in their\\naggregated assets \n The capital accumulation of international banks also made\\nthem increasingly become lending institutions to countries, which made these\\ncountries increasingly dependent on these financial institutions - a key reason\\nfor growing national financial deregulation \n Facilitated\\nby global improvements in communication infrastructure and deregulation of\\ndomestic financial markets, securitization of debts into marketable instruments\\ncontributed to competition and vast expansion of the financial market \n Banks\\nsecuritized formerly illiquid ‘assets‘, such as a mortgage loans into ‘new‘\\nfinancial products, which could be traded on the stock market \n TNCs increased\\ncapitalization by issuing equities \n Additionally, nation states participated in\\nthe financial market by issuing bonds to increase liquidity for themselves.\\nAnother ‘innovative‘ financial product concerns the emergence of a secondary\\nmortgage market in the United States (U.S.) \n  Formerly illiquid debts became\\ntransformed into liquid and tradable mortgage-backed securities that were\\ntraded on the stock exchange \n In particular with domestic financial\\nliberalization in the early 1990s, individuals and institutional investors\\nsignificantly contributed to an internationalization of financial market\\nactivities by the purchase of equities, shares and bonds \n The volume of\\ninternational equity issued in 1986 was at US$32 billion \n In 1999 it rose to\\nthe staggering amount of US$28 trillion \n Real estate\\ndevelopment and globalization  The\\ntransformation of the urban built environment reflects the global-local\\ninterplay of globalisation forces \n [ \n ] \n  The real estate sector is also\\nan investment form, which boosts through speculation the artificial production\\nof the building stock in globalising cities \n There\\nare three main developments, which have contributed to the emergence of a\\nglobal real estate market \n First,\\nthe global economy‘s shift towards banking and producer service activities\\ndramatically increased the demand for offices \n [ \n ] \n  Since the 1980s, that has led to the construction of\\nmillions of sq m of new office space \n ―The rapid building of one high-rise office\\ncomplex after another has transformed cities all across the world \n Secondly,\\nthere was an internationalisation of the office market by its developers, users\\nand owners \n [ \n ] \n  Increasing prices and growing demand for\\noffice development produced record profits and attracted domestic and foreign\\ninvestors \n Panreiter emphasises that major cities, in particular those that\\nhave dynamic developments in advanced producer services, also correspond high\\non cross-border real estate investment \n Part of these increasing cross-border\\nreal estate transactions are based on the fact that the financial sector are\\nusers and buyers of the commercial properties \n [ \n ] \n   Understanding\\nthat real estate development is a very capital-intensive economic sector, real\\nestate construction provided an ideal investment asset for the financial\\nindustry \n Real estate can act as securities and collateral for bank lending \n In\\nfact, this shows that office markets in globalising cities are linked in an\\ninternational real estate and capital market \n [ \n ] \n   Thirdly,\\nnew types of institutional investment by the end of the 1970s in form of\\npension funds and insurance companies increased global real estate activities.\\nConsiderable growth rates in the service sector, which promised constantly\\nincreasing profits and the search for new long-term investment opportunities,\\nwere major driving forces of institutional expansion \n [ \n ] \n  A\\nkey aspect for the emergence of a global real estate market is the financial\\nliberalisation [ \n ] \n  In\\nparticular, the securitisation of former fixed real estate assets into stocks\\nand securities through real estate investment trusts (REITs) increased\\nliquidity, transparency and capital volume for national and international\\nproperty development \n [ \n ] \n  Predominantly\\nthe securitisation of real estate from a fixed asset into a liquid and tradable\\ncommodity enhanced global real estate market activities \n A study by Jones Lang\\nLaSalle in 2008 showed that the volume in direct commercial property investment\\nhas more than doubled from US$354 billion in 2003 to US$759 billion in 2007.\\nCross-border transactions have been also constantly growing \n In 2003, worldwide\\ncross-border commercial property transaction accounted for US$90 billion \n That\\nvolume grew to a staggering amount of US$353 billion in 2007 \n The promising\\nyears of economic development between 2000 and 2007 also provided Asia-Pacific\\nwith impressive economic growth rates \n Cross-border transactions on commercial\\nproperty accounted for 32 percent in 2006, and rapidly grew one year later to a\\nremarkable 47 percent of all commercial property transactions in the region \n [ \n ] \n  Other\\nfactors also increased real estate activities and their globalization \n The\\nglobal expansion of TNCs increased not just the demand for commercial real\\nestate, but also the demand for residential property development, driven by a\\ngrowing mobile expatriate population worldwide \n The number of worldwide\\nmigrants almost doubled from 136 million in 1990 to 210 million in 2010 \n Stimulating\\nurban growth through housing and office construction has also successfully\\nimpacted countries economic development by understanding how other supporting\\nservices such as financing; architecture, consultancy, management and material\\nproduction are involved in real estate production \n [ \n ]"},{"msgID":7208,"texte":"We have just seen the ECB cutting interest rates to almost zero \n That means we have a low interest rate \n I'm not sure about the state

multiples is an exacting art form, because there are so many reasons that multiples can differ, not all of which relate to true differences in value \n For example, different accounting policies can result in diverging multiples for otherwise identical operating businesses \n The use of multiples only reveals patterns in relative values, not absolute values such as those obtained from discounted
