multiples based on the business strategy they employ \n For example valuating Amazon could be difficult as part of their strategy includes re-investing all their positive cashflows towards new products, research and development, and property, as examples \n Sometimes, it's hard to use PE ratios where there is no likely comparison \n Any values that result of that comparison will not help an investor reach a fair value \n Further, as a summary, I have found the following explanations as to why multiples can distort the full picture of a company's valuation \n There are a number of criticisms levied against multiples, but in the main these can be summarised as:   Simplistic: A multiple is a distillation of a great deal of information into a single number or series of numbers \n By combining many value drivers into a point estimate, multiples may make it difficult to disaggregate the effect of different drivers, such as growth, on value \n The danger is that this encourages simplistic – and possibly erroneous – interpretation \n Static: A multiple represents a snapshot of where a firm is at a point in time, but fails to capture the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of business and competition \n Difficulties in comparisons: Multiples are primarily used to make comparisons of relative value \n But comparing multiples is an exacting art form, because there are so many reasons that multiples can differ, not all of which relate to true differences in value \n For example, different accounting policies can result in diverging multiples for otherwise identical operating businesses \n Dependence on correctly valued peers: The use of multiples only reveals patterns in relative values, not absolute values such as those obtained from discounted cash flow valuations \n If the peer group as a whole is incorrectly valued (such as may happen during a stock market \"bubble\") then the resulting multiples will also be misvalued \n Short-term: Multiples are based on historic data or near-term forecasts \n Valuations based on multiples will therefore fail to capture differences in projected performance over the longer term, and will have difficulty correctly valuing cyclical industries unless somewhat subjective normalization adjustments are made"},{"msgID":597,"texte":"I think that such bailout is more necessary for economy than bad for banks,

was like trying to give valuation of Nokia phones to an iPhone in its early years \n LL was a rapidly growing brand and assigning it a PE of a mature company didn't feel ideal \n Hence, DCF valuation was the most optimum method \n In case of negative earnings it is important to identify the source of negative earnings, if it is a one off event or recurring event, Or if the the company is still in

deal of information into a single number or series of numbers \n By combining many value drivers into a point estimate, multiples may make it difficult to dis-aggregate the effect of different drivers, such as growth, on value \n The danger is that this encourages simplistic – and possibly erroneous – interpretation.\\n Static: A multiple represents a snapshot of where a firm is at a point in time, but fails to capture the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of business and competition.\\n Difficulties in comparisons: Multiples are primarily used to make comparisons of relative value \n But comparing multiples is an exacting art form, because there are so many reasons that multiples can differ, not all of which relate to true differences in value \n For example, different accounting policies can result in diverging multiples for otherwise identical operating businesses.\\n Dependence on correctly valued peers: The use of multiples only reveals patterns in relative values, not absolute values such as those obtained from discounted cash flow valuations \n If the peer group as a whole is incorrectly valued (such as may happen during a stock market \"bubble\") then the resulting multiples will also be misvalued.\\n Short-term: Multiples are based on historic data or near-term forecasts \n Valuations based on multiples will therefore fail to capture differences in projected performance over the longer term, and will have difficulty correctly valuing cyclical industries unless somewhat subjective normalization adjustments are made"},{"msgID":4302,"texte":"From
