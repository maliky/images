Secondly, this bailout was organised for systematically important banks only, and without so, the economy as a whole would have been put in great danger \n Bailouts were not organised for poorly managed banks, but only those deemed at risk for the economy as a whole \n These two points are very important to recall, because they just speak for themselves \n It was a cost-efficient solution to respond to a highly risky situation \n Believing that the ethical implications can outweigh the excellent solution, technically speaking, that the U.S \n Government brought at that very time, does not seem reasonable to me \n If it had to be done again, it surely should be the case \n Now, picking up this side of the debate does not mean that the ethical implications should be completely offset \n It is critical in my opinion to combine this view with a stricter approach on two dimensions \n First, the U.S \n Government should make sure to use the profits from TARP, minus inflation, to provide extra resources to forensic and investigative departments analysing the historical wrongdoers (in additional to their regular budget, as a sort of \"bonus\" cashflow) \n  Secondly, the implication of some key executive individuals at the systematically important institutions, is so sensitive to the wider economy and the society at large, that they should be subject to the same level of personal responsibility that judiciary, military or governmental personnel may have \n That includes, to speak bluntly, criminal responsibility in some cases \n As such, I strongly believe that the best answer to the current debate around public bailouts is to keep being supportive of them, to avoid at any cost a bigger crisis, while at the same time strengthening both investigative and retaliatory options

Where the government dropped the ball was to give the bankers complete freedom to do whatever they wanted with the 3.5 Trillion USD of the taxpayers money \n This could have been avoided if a society had a control signal to modulate corruption between the politicians and the bankers \n This is a signal similar to what the central banks use to modulate the economy, by controlling interest rates \n This signal is called educating the masses of the white collar corruption that exists in practically all nations of the world \n Ultimately a sound economic functioning of a society is the responsibility of its own citizens, thus a society should create adequate infrastructure, such that maximum transparency is created at all levels of the government \n Once the people of a country realise that it is the very rich and the high powered government servants are the root cause of this economic meltdown, where millions of its citizens will suffer its bad consequences, then society as a whole will realise that in order to have a sustainable system in which even the crooked amongst us also do have a need to survive, then it becomes mandatory to mitigate corruption and not to exceed it beyond a certain threshold level for all of its citizens to live in moderate stability and safety of its societal structural systems, i.e \n Political, legal, educational, commercial, etc. This is ultimately a problem of squarely looking at our own human nature, which at a fundamental level does not believe that honesty and honor has any place in today's economic market place, once people

the future to retrieve those losses, or at least a percentage of it \n If you want to take a conservative approach, I would recommend holding from 15% to 20% of gold in your porfolio \n Many may thing

moderate return rates and risk \n You aren't particularly interested in earning very high amounts of money from your investments \n You prefer moderate\/low returns with considerably low risk by holding, for example, a high percentage of AAA bonds in your porfolio \n In this escenario, I would recommend holding from 10% to 15% of gold since you still need some kind of insurance \n If you are a paranoid, though, and you are worried about possible economic downturns or \"black swans,\" you may want to hold 20% of gold, possibly more \n During the financial global crisis we saw how CDOs, even the safest, lost their value and caused billionaire losses to banks and other financial institutions \n Therefore gold, in case of recession, can back you up against it to a degree, so it is wise to have a big portion of your porfolio in gold in a situation like that \n And as we saw in this week's lessons, it is better to invest in gold when the economy is stable and its price is relatively
