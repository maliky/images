reflexion, and I am happy to offer a tentative answer to it \n First of all, the U.S \n Government did not simply \"waste\" public's money with the bailouts \n TARP program ended in a net profit for the U.S \n Government, regrouping $441 billions out of $426 invested in a 6-years timespan \n So the public's purse did not waste a single cent with this action, inflation accounted for. Secondly, this bailout was organised for systematically important banks only, and without so, the economy as a whole would have been put in great danger \n Bailouts were not organised for poorly managed banks, but only those deemed at risk for the economy as a whole \n These two points are very important to recall, because they just speak for themselves \n It was a cost-efficient solution to respond to a highly risky situation \n Believing that the ethical implications can outweigh the excellent solution, technically speaking, that the U.S \n Government brought at that very time, does not seem reasonable to me \n If it had to be done again, it surely should be the case \n Now, picking up this side of the debate does not mean that the ethical implications should be completely offset \n It is critical in my opinion to combine this view with a stricter approach on two dimensions \n First, the U.S \n Government should make sure to use the profits from TARP, minus inflation, to provide extra resources to forensic and investigative departments analysing the historical wrongdoers (in additional to their regular budget, as a sort of \"bonus\" cashflow) \n  Secondly, the implication of some key executive individuals at the systematically important institutions, is so sensitive to the wider economy and the society at large, that they should be subject to the same level of personal responsibility that judiciary, military or governmental personnel may have \n That includes, to speak bluntly, criminal responsibility in some cases \n As such, I strongly believe that the best answer to the current debate around public bailouts is to keep being supportive of them, to avoid at any cost a bigger crisis, while at the same time strengthening both investigative and retaliatory options against wrongdoers \n Attempting to bear the cost on other (innocent) investors, or the public at large, does not seem to be the most ethical solution a society could wish
