consumers in the real economy had not been equally compensated for their losses), it was an essential policy in recovering the US economy, which was highly dependent on access to credit like most developed economies \n After the 2008 crisis, house prices, wages and the general economy had recovered to pre-2008 highs and has in fact exceeded those highs in several industries \n According to the Bailout Scorecard, the Treasury lent $623 billion in bailouts, the bulk of which was disbursed to financial institutions, the automotive industry, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have now been taken over by the Federal Government \n In return, they received $708 billion through the principle amount being paid back, in addition to dividends, interest earnings and sales of other assets and equities \n In order to prevent careless behaviour and to prevent perverse incentives for banks, new regulation would have to be put in place \n It is my belief that Dodd Frank isn't particularly effective in this regard, because it doesn't re-incorporate the Glass Steagall Act into its regulations - a piece of legislation that creates a clear separation between commercial and investment banking \n In my view, the Dodd Frank legislation has also distorted competition in the financial sector by imposing excessive legislation on smaller community banks and credit unions, drastically reducing their ability to compete with larger financial firms in the bulge bracket, who have the means to absorb increased regulation through compliance and legal departments \n This has in effect led to the industry being dominated by oligopolies; the biggest financial services firms are bigger in terms of market capitalisation, than they were before the 2008 crisis \n To summarise, I believe that

has some skin in the game, whether it be a pension plan, executive stock options, continued employment, or professional reputation \n Remove enough of this risk of failure thus increases the odds of greater risk-taking by the bankers (hence the banks) in the future \n Moreover, programs such as TARP penalized good actors in two ways \n First, it kept afloat competitors whose employees had made bad decisions and thus hindered the natural ability of markets to reward those who make good decisions and punish those who make bad decisions \n Bankruptcy is analogous to allowing natural forest fires to periodically clear out the underbrush: if you suppress all forest first, the deadwood and underbrush accumulates and, when a fire inevitably breaks out, it is far more catastrophic \n Second,

a key statistic that is assumed to relate to that value \n You would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies when that statistic – whether earnings, cash flow or some other measure – does not bear a logical relationship to the market value observed, when it is not seen as the driver of that market value \n A multiple is a distillation of a great deal of information into a single number or series of numbers \n By combining many value drivers into a point estimate, multiples may make it difficult to disaggregate the effect of different drivers, such

capture the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of business and competition \n Multiples are primarily used to make comparisons of relative value \n But comparing multiples is an exacting art form, because there are so many reasons that multiples can differ, not all of which relate to true differences in value \n For example, different accounting policies can result in diverging multiples for otherwise identical operating businesses \n The use of multiples only reveals patterns in relative values, not absolute values such as those obtained from discounted cash flow valuations \n If the peer group as a whole is incorrectly valued (such as may happen during a stock market \"bubble\") then the resulting multiples will also be misvalued \n Multiples are based on historic data or near-term forecasts \n Valuations based on multiples will therefore fail to capture differences in projected performance over the longer term, and will have difficulty correctly valuing cyclical

price would be for it), there are different methods to estimate the value of that company \n There are two primary methods presented in this course so far: DCF and Multiples \n First method, multiples: now, as you may know, multiples are based on the idea that you can compare two companies and base a valuation of off that \n But we're talking primarily about DCF and Terminal Value \n The idea behind valueing the company using a DCF is that you take the company's future Fcf's (which are then discounted for the time value of money: inflation) \n  Generally, you will do a DCF by taking 4 to 7 years of future cash flows \n Remember that enterprise value is calculated as follows (also see lectures and slides): V0 = ( FCF1 \/ ( 1 + Rwacc )) + ( FCF2  \/ (( 1 + Rwacc ) ^2 ) +  ( FCFn  + Vn \/ (( 1 + Rwacc ) ^ n )  What does this mean \n It means that we calculate firm value by taking all free cash flows, discount them over the years, and then sum then \n However, we only do the free cash flows for a couple of years (e.g \n 4-7 years), that is why we take the terminal value for the remaining years (assuming the company keeps on functioning, continuing) \n   Let us assume that Company A has the following FcF: 2015: 1 million FCF And we believe that this will keep growing by 5% each year \n Then the result for a simple analysis would be (rounded _smiley_  2016: 1.05 mil 2017:  1.1 mil 2018:  1.16 mil 2019:  1.22 mil However, we also need to discount these cash flows \n Let us assume the discount rate is 9% \n  That would mean the relevant FcFs would be: (The FcF \/ ( Discount rate ^ years ) ) 2016:  0.96 mil  (1.05 million \/ ( 1.09 ^ 1 ) ) 2017:  0.93 mil ( 1.1 million \/ ( 1.09 ^ 2) 2018:  0.90 mil ( 1.16 million \/ ( 1.09 ^ 3) 2019: 0.86 mil ( 1.22 million \/ ( 1.09 ^ 4) That is a total of: 3.65 million \n Note:    But, we also need to calculate the terminal value \n The formula for the terminal value is as follows:  Vn = ( ( 1 + Gfcf ) \/ ( Rwacc - Gfcf ) ) x FcFn This means that for your terminal value you divide your growth factor (5% in my case, so 1.05) by your discount rate minus your growth factor (so in my case 9 %- 5% = 0.04) \n  In our case this is:   1.05\/0.04 = 26.25 \n And then you apply that number times the cash flow of the last year \n That means, 0.86 million x 26.25 = 22.6 million  Total value:  3.65 mil + 22.6 mil = 26.25 mil  Note: I hope I made no mistakes \n It may be wise to figure out what discount rates are, free cash flows, etc. I hope this helped, let me know if you have

rather, there needs to be a rational argument based on factual premise and thorough analysis against or for a potential course of action \n Another measure that could accompany a bailout is developing something similar to the EPA's Superfund, which was collectively funded by major players in the oil and gas industry in order to allocate government funding for managing environmental liabilities that cannot be funded by the parties responsible \n This fund essentially is a form of government insurance against environmental risks \n Whether such a system has a place in modern banking is debatable \n One final consideration is Hyman Minsky's prediction of boom and bust cycles \n At its most basic level, his theory is that boom and bust cycles are a natural part of the capitalist economy \n In essence, a bust (or burst of a bubble) causes bankers, investors, and governments to behave more rationally and to better account for risks \n In some cases, it is even argued that for a number of years following a bust, stakeholders are overly cautious in their assessments of risk \n However, as the economy begins to prosper, the reign of rationality begins to erode and make way for irrational optimism and speculation \n In aggregate terms, the market reaches a point of instability, in which the previous upward momentum is overpowered by the effects of irrational exuberance, and then collapses as fear takes over and investors lose confidence \n The cycle then repeats itself \n With this consideration in mind, it is possible that history would have repeated itself, in some form or another, regardless of the bailouts - simply due to human nature.\\n\\n To synthesize an answer to the original question based on the above information is not a simple task \n In essence, I think that if the net effect (in net present value terms; NPV) of the bailout was positive, then  by all means, it is a rational course of action \n The first problem comes when determining the actual net benefit based on how this bailout will affect bankers' perception of risk in the future \n This variable is highly unknown and impossible to determine objectively with absolute certainty \n The second problem is perhaps the issue of imposing sanctions or taking punitive action against the key players in the banking industry, whether they were bankers or credit rating agencies \n This again is a difficult question to answer; however, I think it is still important to consider this alternative in NPV terms as to whether it may deter future reckless behaviour \n Again, quantifying this variable would be difficult \n Perhaps an approach that I would find most favourable is an analysis (albeit imperfect) showing the rationale for the decision to impose a bailout (with or without sanctions) and its expected net benefit to the national economy in the long run. Such an analysis should clearly state its assumptions and be open for public scrutiny by academics and (disinterested) professionals \n Although this analysis may not be a perfect representation of reality, it is nonetheless important to attempt to quantify the potential benefits, costs, and risks of any course of action involving such a large sum of money"},{"msgID":2191,"autID":151,"disID":415,"theID":4,"ts":1473442500000,"texte":"I would have a say 1 fifth in gold"},{"msgID":4200,"autID":354,"disID":266,"theID":4,"ts":1469921995000,"texte":"In my opinion, here I think difficult to find some comparable firms, one reason is what companies u think comparable \n Difficult to evaluate, cozy some figures from companies might be fake or Sth else, another reason is dopiffeicult to find firms they are in the same developing stage and meanwhile in the same industry, so I won't use this methods to value the price of equities"},{"msgID":7020,"autID":892,"disID":394,"theID":3,"ts":1502729643000,"texte":"Thank you for the answer"}]
