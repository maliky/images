overvalued \n If we consider, for example, oil and gas companies in emerging markets such as Russia and Ukraine where the state has almost a monopoly in the industry, the small cap privately owned oil and gas businesses cannot even find a proper peer group for comparison \n The next important requirement for peers comparison is that the relevant group should be consistent in terms of revenue structure, business \"maturity\", debt or simply be alike \n This constitutes another limitation for multiples based methods because  all the companies are different in their own way and normally our knowledge about them is based only on publicly awailable information \n I understand that in this cours we are talking about companies who adhere to the same accounting and reporting standards such as IFRS , US GAAP, or other similar GAAPs (generally accepted accounting principles), while it may not always be the case as each country may have its own standards for financial disclosures \n Hence , the definition of revenue and eventually profit shown by companies in a little known country may also be a subject for discrepancies with the peers in developed markets (countries) \n   The discussed in the course multiples based methods were based on current or past information as opposed to DCF method which takes into consideration future cash inflows and growth rates \n That is in my opinion another disadvantage of multiples methods \n Global demand for some products may change dramatically within industry \n Again in energy sector the price for fossil fuel has dropped from 120 to below 50 usd\/barrel (crude oil Brent) over past few years, the deplition of resources puts under going concern companies producers \n While solar and renewables based energy companies are enjoying stronger growth and future demand (Tesla, Solaris, etc.) \n  Mobile phone companies: Nokia and Blackberry example of failures after years of significant growth couldn't serve as peers to Apple or Samsung (smartphones) while they seemed to be alike \n And finally, the question about p\/e for loss makers \n Well, the purpose of any (commercial) firm is generating profits \n The instinct says investing in loss making companies is a financial suicide \n However if the company is undervalued due to its loss year, it's always worth to ask why there was a loss \n And if the reason was adequate , the investment may be very well rewarded in the future \n It often happens that company underwent some restructuring, was fined by regulator, posted impairment of assets or incurred a loss from discontinued operations \n They not necessary lead to negative EBITDA but significantly lower it \n Financial analysts and accountants call those adverse items as \"one-offs\" \n  One-offs do not typically happen in a due course of business but rather appear as \"black swans\" \n  In this case excluding one - offs from EBITDA or in other words -normalizing EBITDA-  may give us another more accurate picture on the value of the company \n Best regards, Oleksandr"},{"msgID":1018,"autID":900,"disID":126,"theID":4,"ts":1467180814000,"texte":"I would rather have a limited amount of gold in my

extreme event that will have an adverse effect on non-gold investments, whereas the return is the interest and\/or gain that one will earn when investing in traditional assets \n In the end, I think there should be a balance, extreme events are highly unlikely (although not impossible) and the number of their occurrence are few and far in between, so might as well take some risk and rake the returns, anyway, in the event that black swans happen, at least the returns you earned during the good times will somehow offset the impact of the negative extreme events \n In conclusion, I will put a small portion of my portfolio in gold investments as hedge but not too much as to forego the gains of holding other investments and\/or

privatizing the profits and socializing the losses \n In contrast, the Glass-Steagall act was introduced at the end of the Great Depression to separate Investment and Retail banking arms thereby preventing excessive risk taking by the speculation activity of Investment banks from adversely affecting the 'real economy' i.e \n Business lending and private debt creation \n The last part of this act was repealed by Clinton in 1999 under massive lobbying from the larger banks and this allowed the creation of banking monoliths such as Citigroup (so-called 'Too Big to Fail' institutions)and also the creation of extremely exotic synthetic investment products such as CDO's, securitized mortgages, virtualized securitized mortgage backed securities underwritten by the ratings agencies who were at once employed and expected to be dispassionate about the risk involved in producing these products which no-one actually understood \n The cross-selling and  mixing of these products by investment banks meant that no-one understood exactly what assets belonged to whom, leading to a loss of confidence and so-called Credit Crunch when banks refused to lend to each without exorbitant inter-bank lending rates \n The Central banks were then called upon to act as the lender of last resort which in this instance was the correct approach as the actual situation at the end of 2008 was much more serious than that in 1929 \n This would have been an effective strategy only in so far as it allowed risky assets to be disposed of and bank balance sheets brought under control reducing the leverage from in some cases up to 40:1 down to more historically manageable levels, perhaps around 9:1 \n This unhappily has not happened, and the opportunity has been lost to achieve this aim. This means that the bank balance sheets are in poor shape as they were and consumers are likewise carrying huge burdens of debt \n Growth levels have been weak because of this and in fact despite the lowest interest rates ever recorded, there is little appetite for more debt \n Debt is linked to growth of consumer spending in the US which has a knock-on effect for exporting economies such as the Eurozone which typically does not have the same level of private consumption"},{"msgID":488,"autID":456,"disID":139,"theID":4,"ts":1492371643000,"texte":"Gold is a proxy for cash but with inflation proofing abilities, therefore it would seem to make sense to hold cash in the form of gold at the same proportion that you would typically hold cash \n There is of course a cost to liquidation of gold that may not exist with cash plus the insurance costs of holding gold \n With that being said, I would be inclined to hold between 5 and 15% in gold depending on the global stability outlook \n Given the current outlook I would tend towards the higher end of this estimate"},{"msgID":4160,"autID":819,"disID":326,"theID":4,"ts":1536538421000,"texte":"Some of the companies we are comparing with can have specifics that are not very knows and thus - putting them into different pool with the company we are evaluating \n Comparing two companies can be a tricky exercise"},{"msgID":5543,"autID":3261,"disID":221,"theID":4,"ts":1509978956000,"texte":"The assumption is that both company must have same financial structure and their may  be the chance that market is not representing the fair value of companies like in dotcom bubble \n It can be used for companies that are reporting losses by using P\/E ratio"},{"msgID":5102,"autID":205,"disID":218,"theID":4,"ts":1466551651000,"texte":"Depends on market trend but I'll go with the small part of gold in my portfolio for insurance I can use options"},{"msgID":1052,"autID":924,"disID":266,"theID":4,"ts":1470160003000,"texte":"When we use the same ratio to compare and value companies, we have to think that a company could have a different business strategy than other \n Also, if the companies are in different countries, we have to analyze the macroeconomic cycles of the countries \n For example, I think we should not use the multiple-based valuation method to value a company of an emerging market using a multiple of firms in Europe"},{"msgID":2255,"autID":1403,"disID":197,"theID":4,"ts":1514753427000,"texte":"It is necessary"},{"msgID":6368,"autID":2486,"disID":389,"theID":4,"ts":1502748906000,"texte":"That other companies are valued fairly \n Bubble situations (e.g \n _domain_ , 2008 crises) \n  In terms of negative earnings we shall look at earnings over longer period"},{"msgID":6275,"autID":2525,"disID":153,"theID":4,"ts":1457907544000,"texte":"None in the USA.

number of factors: international sanctions and oil price shock led to increased outflow of capital from Russia which resulted in increased demand for foreign currency and substantial devaluation of Russian ruble \n Devaluation led to increased prices of imported products and to increased prices of domestic products as well, since domestic producers decided that they can increase prices and still remain competitive in comparison to imports \n As a result, inflation in the country increased sharply \n In such a situation it could be logical to assume that if someone invested in real estate in Russia before all these events, she could be ptotected from inflation \n However, what we witnessed in RE market after those events is that due to all these factors the purchasing power of Russian citizens decreased, since their daily expenses increased, so their demand for RE investments decreased as well \n Thus, not only the prices of RE assets have not been adjusted for devaluation, they fell even in RUR terms together with rental payments, which also fell \n Thus, for example, owners of flats, which let them for rent, not only were unprotected from inflation, but were hit by it and their investments decreased in value \n Here is a short article about the RE price movements in Russia:    So, it seems that when hedge is mostly needed during the time when inflation jumps, RE
