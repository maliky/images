1581,"It depends on investors profile, if the investor is conservative he/she should probably maintain a large portion of portfolio invested in gold whether someone who wants to have higher returns and understands higher risk related to that should only have small portion invested in gold"
7741,"I personally would like to invest somewhere between 10-15% of my portfolio in gold at all time 
 This share of my investment pie can increase up to 30% at the turbulence"
6475,"I guess there are many assumptions: one of them is that the information is correct, something that can't always be taken for granted 
 The other, that the earnings of a company in a given year is truly representative of its real situation and prospective earnings in the future"
4809,"The  _domain_  bubble market psychology drove multiples well beyond realistically expectations of future cash flow 
 This lottery driven mentality pushed  valuations well beyond reason and resulted in a rapid and expensive market correction 
 SaaS company valuations (Recurring Revenue x multiple) has had the same effect of overvaluation"
669,"There is however a very important assumption we make when we use ratios we observe on the market (like price-to-earnings) to value other comparable companies 
 What could that assumption be 
 The assumption is that companies trade at a fair market value in the short term 
 Were there instances in history where you would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies 
 Yes, specially when because of policy the expected rates of return where distorted, for example with the Fed or Central Banks easing money to the financial system and lowering the interest rates that in turn would have lowered the expected rates from investors in equities which by using the Multiple-based Valuation Methods  would have driven the prices up making the companies more valuable fictitiously 
 What about companies that just reported a loss (i.e 
 Negative earnings) 
  They can always be evaluated but based on sales, but this shot term valuation would no t necessarily reflect a fair market value"
9131,Yes
7883,I've rounded my answer to 25 (as it was said in the question: round to the nearest number) and it was accepted
5326,"The assumption mentioned is: we expect that equity price reflects fair company value which is not always true 
 The whole specific industry might be overestimated (so called ""bubble"") the way is happened in early 2000s with Internet/ _domain_  businesses 
 The second problem: we can't use P/E or other ratios when estimating companies which do not generate positive cash flow: startups, early stage companies etc"
919,"We are assuming the comparable firms are in the similar growth stage, similar industry and financial structure"
2335,I think from here
2690,"I think both, the bailout was completly necesary you cant as a goverment let the hole financial industry  (banking, insurance, loans, Mortgages etc) go under because of the domino efect that would had in other industies that rely on the banking sector, plus other cosequences like unemployment in conclusion the whole US economy would collapse, but in the other hand you give all these incentives to the banks  and who guarantys that in the next financial crisis the US goverment its no going to have to go rescue the banks again, speacially  if its still an unregualeted sector more worried to make profits with new finacial instruments more complex, in a 7 years bull market are they prepare for the correction 
 Or prepare for next buble?i think of more that bad incentives we need more regulation both for the banking sector and what these banks are aloud to trade "
4452,"It is worrying as it has set an unprecedented example for bailing troubled financial institutions rather than letting the market to adjust 
 I think a bigger recession is coming"
1954,"From my opinion, bailout of the financial sector is sometime necessary 
 Without the help of government, the superior amount of bad debt will lead to enormous unemployment and it leads to huge social tension 
 In the other side, regulation must be set. Government should set the boundary for the bank business 
 The regulation and independent business should be combined together"
2198,"I am more worried about the potential consequences of this bailout in terms of bad incentives for banks 
 I think the economy itself should be able to recover from the crisis 
 What the government did just break the balance"
8455,Small
2863,"I'm clue less about the situation in USA, but I know that in Europe there is a law that impose the bail in of the banks in case they do bankrupt 
 On my personal point of view, the problem is ""banks"" as a whole, I mean that the mechanism of credit distribution doesn't work anymore in the real world 
 The distribution of wealth is very unequal and unfair and the death of the middle class impose some change in terms of government priorities  
  In the European situation, in Italy foremost, banks have not any incentives to land money, because they have already a big amount of mortgage contracts in their portfolios"
1919,"I believe in being prepared in all cases, with that said it seems like a fine balance is required 
 The idea would be to minimize the negative effects of something is something bad happens to your investments not necessarily to insure them 
 I believe as your investments mature and you age as well a rebalancing to purchase more gold as an insurance policy would be required 
 I believe a younger investor can ride the ups and downs with less effects over the duration 
 So a portion of gold in this case to minimize the losses"
384,"P/E ratio is calculated using historical performances, which might be the best forecasting method available, but are never a reliable one. In a bear market, I might have felt comfortable using this method because all companies ""seem"" to be doing well in terms of yielding positive returns 
 If a company reports a loss in the period of time during which its performance is being assessed, we might have a negative P/E ratio, but over the whole period of the companies existence, the P/E might be positive 
 So, I would dig deep to see whether the reported loss was because of a temporary loss of performance or whether the flaw was really fundamental, before deciding to invest in it or not"
9162,"Yes, Aristeidis it is a great idea for some degree of interventionism is put in place to curtail their excesses 
 I wonder if any such interventionism exists 
 I don't think the terrible state of the bank's books was absolutely their fault since it was a result of the bubble in the 80s, however, if another bubble takes place, the US will still have to perform the ""TARP"" again 
 It seems more like a cycle to me"
5393,"The truth is that banks are the institutions that ""create"" money and therefore are invaluable to the economic growth and well-being of the society 
 Despite these facts, banks are private companies owned be private shareholders, so their main incentive is to make more profit 
 The subprime crisis in 2008 was to a certain extent a matter of greed from financial institutions (and also private investors) who found a way to make more and more money without considering the bubble that was being created 
 As a conclusion, I believe that the banks needed to be saved because the economy cannot grow without them 
 But the government should learn from financial crisis like the 2008 one, and take some serious measures and regulations for financial institutions, in order to prevent future crises"
4882,"\nI highly recommend 'Corporate Finance Essentials' offered by the IESE Business School, here in Coursera 
 It explains in detail, but very intuitively too, many of the concepts that this course discusses, like returns, risk, diversification and the Cost of Capital.\n\n"
2834,The assumption that we make is the future cash flow is growing in a constant rate
2730,Why is currency risk more significant in bonds than in equities
6932,There could be other factors like depreciation which contributes this
1768,"Gold works like insurance of a portfolio,  which is largely consist of stocks and bonds 
 Just like any other insurance premium gold part should be relatively smaller percentage like 5 to 10% of total asset allocation thus in case of economic crush like 2008, the overall portfolio still retain some of its value"
8159,"1) we assume the ratios are based on pure financial values, while other external/internal factors could impact on these values like financial crises, industry crises, M&A, investments, mortgages, etc. 2) as said, financial crises like 2007-2009, but also Amazon extraordinary revenue based on cloud services AWS revenues or when Vivendi bought a big slice of Mediaset shares 
 3) ratios could not be used and multiple-based valuation would be useful to understand how far is the Company from being in the arena 
 I would investigate more on the reasons 
 Like: If also other similar Companies are in the same situation then the industry is under a crises and I would not invest"
3614,"As such events although not impossible,are very unlikely to happen 
 So it would not really be a wise strategy to invest a large part of the portfolio in gold because then we tend to lose out on the opportunity to make money by using other financial assets 
 But,nevertheless investing some amount of money in gold for security purposes is always a welcome move 
 Since ages, in my country-India,parents have been investing in gold by buying jewellery such as rings, necklaces and bangles so that they can use these assets during their child's marriage ceremony which often is celebrated as a huge event 
 So this thing has been going on till now and therefore I can say that people of India have been practicing gold investment since a very long time"
8525,A relatively small part
5752,"I m akshita singhal from India 
 I am very much excited for the module 
 Hope to learn new things"
2764,I would tend to the option to have a larger part of gold in my portfolio
6514,"I think US government or any others\naround the world bailout of  its financial sector was simply\nnecessary for the well-being of the economy as a whole because US\ngovernment wanted to help the US economy to recover faster from the\nsub prime  crisis by removing illiquid and difficult-to-value assets\nfrom banks balance sheet encouraging them to lend money to the real\neconomy 
 Actually, here is no bad incentives\nfor banks, so having no scope to be worried about the potential\nconsequences of this bailout"
5112,"I think that if the opposite happens and the yen rises, then the investment in euros would be profitable 
 And that is why when investing you have to keep in mind the currency gap and treat it separately 
 Hope i helped."
7652,"Ok, I think we get a certificate after completing the 4 courses + cap stone project 
 It says so on the course main page 
 Anyone correct me if I'm wrong"
8292,"A larger percentage; because I think conservatively, maybe 20%"
6736,"I don't know how necessary the TARP program was, but it has seemed to help 
 I think there should be more oversight with the banks so they are not so careless with their future activities 
 I think the Dodd-Frank bill was a step in the right direction, but not perfect"
8781,A relatively small part of one's portfolio in gold should be enough to safely insure part of the investments against negative events and losses
7138,How did you get the answer
7943,"Hi, you basically solved it so I am not sure about the question:   We have (1 + R)^45 =  40   so if we extract the 45th root of 40 we have 40^(1/45) = 1.08542- This is equal to 1+ the rate so we subtract one and have  .085 =  8.5%"
742,I think that 10% of your portfolio should be invested in gold
8256,May be 20 %
2562,"I would make a couple of caveats here: overall, I think 25-33% is my target range, but I'm not just talking about gold 
 This includes physical gold, but also physical silver, (maybe also small amounts of platinum/palladium) as well as a small percentage in mining stocks (a huge growth potential but very high volatility) 
  I have been in the precious metals business for about 15 years now and it's treated me quite well"
6091,I hope to find the course useful
7669,"Hi Jaime I was thinking far to complicated when trying to find the correct answer to this question 
 Actually it's a very simple calculation:   Take your answer from Question 3 and subtract the given share value of 35 USD from it and you're done  _smiley_"
4764,"The multiple-based valuation methodology is more difficult to apply for private companies, start-up companies, biotech firms and companies that experienced losses"

1210,"I think that gold standard should be put in place 
 I think that poor countries would not be in position to implement quantitative easing policies as it would be considered as bogus and fraudulent money"
1351,"It would depend on my current situation and strategy 
 If I would be on a long term shot, then I would rather leave a very small portion of the portfolio on gold 
 If I would be close to my retirement, my strategy would be to secure my portfolio, therefore I would increase the amount of it"
149,"The final gold of a government should be to the well-being of their citizens 
 By taking such measure the economy reactivates and with that the citizens might be in a better position 
 Having said that, governments should point the responsibles and take the measures to correct the whatever causes the subprime crisis"

5130,"To valuate a company using ratios of comparable enterprises we have to assume that comparable companies have similar growth rates, returns on investments, operating margins and are operating in the same region 
 Using such a approach have many limitations 
 Even firms in the same industry can have very different capital structures, risk levels, and growth rates, all of which affect ratios 
 In my opinion, comparison of a company's ratio with industry peers ratios should not be the only factor on which we decide to buy or sell stocks 
 A company could have negative earnings for a lot of reasons 
 The company could just be a bad company and could have had a one time occurrence that just affected the earnings 
 That's why we shouldn't  valuate a company using only ratios 
 DCF method is much better to value companies with negative earnings however is quite complex"
4129,"Some companies rise to absurd valuation multiples like several hundred times earnings

5815,"That the market as a whole is fairly valued 
 The pre-2000 internet bubble-burst, where P/E of Internet stocks were extremely high, without proper fundamentals and any realistic hope of future earnings to justify their share prices, is (obviously because retrospectively) a time I wouldn't have felt comfortable using P/E to value companies 
 Companies reporting a loss is a different matter 
 This requires analyzing the causes for this loss, whether it's likely to be a one-time occurrence, due to temporary macro conditions."
5866,"I will invest around 45% of my investment portfolio in gold so that I can hedge against unlikely events and high inflation rates

8133,"I have just taken this quiz, yet I am wondering about question 7 
 We are given a P/E ratio for comparable companies of 9 with earnings for XYZ of 400 MUSD 
 According to the lectures, in order to compute the estimated price per share, we should compute 400*9 = 3600 MUSD 
 But before diving by the number of shared outstanding, we should first subtract debt, right 
 That would yield 3600 - 1000 = 2600 MUSD leaving a price per share of 26 USD/share 
 YET the quiz takes 26 USD/share to be wrong

4896,"Great question 
 I believe in this case one had to measure 
 It begs the questions;    Had the US government not bailed out the banks, how slow would the recovery had been, if there would have been a recovery at all?    What has the bailing achieved 
 Was there an alternative that could have provided the same or better result 
 For me I take it as a necessary evil because the US and the dollar are often used for bench marking and therefore their performance affects the world economy 
 The next step for me is asking, what policies and regulations by governments and other regulatory bodies have been formulated to guard against devastation such as the subprime crisis"
2922,"The assumption that we make when using ratios we observe on the market is that the 'comparable"" companies, or, in general, the area in which these companies are operating, are/is fairly priced 
 As an example, during the tech bubble, the technology sphere, and hence the companies operating n that sphere were highly overvalued, and the multiples-based valuation method would result in an equally overvalued prediction"
2454,"When I first read the discussion and without doing any research I thought about 20% for a large investor and about 5-10% for a small investor 
 I don't really have experience in investing etc. but I thought that people seek more insurance when dealing and investing with a large amount of money than the ones with small 
 After reading a lit bit around the subject peoples opinions tend to be that since gold's main purpose is an insurance policy and it just site there, on average an investors should allocate approximately 10% of his/her portfolio in gold"

3986,"I would have a relatively large part of my portfolio invested in Gold (maximum 20%) not only as an insurance for a black swan event but also because its value have been increasing over the years unlike currencies which fluctuates from time to time 
 As mentioned in the videos, gold are used as a hedge against inflation, deflation and also against the declining in the dollar value 
 Although these are some critical reasons why persons who are not risk takers should invest a large part of their portfolio in gold, it's not truly my reason for choosing that amount 
 The reason is that gold has preserve its value for thousand of years from way back to 3000 BC and the value has been increasing steadily ever since due to the increasing demand over these years 
 Gold has become part of cultures and traditions for some countries which leads to its demand, and an increase in demand always lead to an increase in price"

3361,"Because earning can be manipulated, also extraordinary items can skew earning, non recurring can influence earnings as well"
1639,"Two assumptions that have to be made: 1) That one company performs exactly as the other company's 
 The multiple chosen would be the multiple from the nearest competitor 
 2) That the industry's average is representable enough for the firms in the industry 
 This again has a sub-assumption that all of these companies in this industries perform exactly as the average 
 However, these assumptions can be misleading since nowadays a lot of companies also diversify to increase the possible synergies thus increasing their competitive advantage 
 This might lead to ""incompatibility"" of using the multiples of only one industry 
 Even though they don't diversify, still it's completely misleading to ""generalize"" the companies 
 This thought is even more challenged that companies try to be ahead of its peers (from the same industry) and thus creating significant multiple deviations among them 
 Another robust multiple-based valuation methods is to take an average-over-time multiples of industries or main competitors to avoid the real-time effect of companies that just reported a loss (e.g 
 As occurred now in Oil and Gas sector)"
6422,"Because during bubbles in the market the P/E ration might not give the fair price of companies from the same industry, so this valuation method might give a wrong indication, whereas the DCF method focuses on the company itself and in such a market it gives a better indication regarding the fair market value of company and hence the fairer stock price"

35,"Each method has its advantages and its disadvantages 
 The DCF method, for example, allows the intrinsic value of an equity to be justified, it relies FCF rather than accounting figure 
 On the flip side, DCF is based on assumptions on inputs (growth rate, required return on equity, etc) and it is often difficult to forecast cash flows in cyclical businesses 
 The multiples-based valuation methods are easy to apply and understand and there are fewer assumptions made as with DCF. However, the choice of multiples used can be subjective (or multiples maybe mis-priced by the market) 
  Occasionally, it can be difficult to find the right peer group or relevant comps"

 The central banks try to control the quantity but if foreigns transfers increase this means extra liquidity and better level of assets in commercial banks 
 And that drive the commercial banks to have better grade and to borrow money cheapest"
4207,"I think that the central banks needed to step in and buy assets from the financial sector as their demise would have affected all of the citizens who had their savings invested with them 
 This could be seen as reckless as the financial sector has been able to pass along the risk to the central banks and general population rather than assume it themselves 
 As long as bail out is accompanied with legislative reform then this should mean that in the future the banks are not incentivised to repeat the same dangerous behaviours"

5921,"Well, it only works if there is trust in the USD. As soon as that tumbles there may be a problem 
 Lets say the US isn't able to get their debt under control and technically default, than - atleast what I would do - Investors and governments will pull out of the US Currency, exchanging for stable currencies and reserves, thus weakening the dollar further and making the USA dependend on (cheap) Export 
 With the current Oil Prices that won't fix it 
 And if the Petro-Dollar system will crash, due to weak USD, and the Oil will be denominated in an other currency, it will weaken the USD even more until the US will default 
 I guess that they will use War to push Oil-Prices up and blackmail governments into not changing the reserve currency system 
 So basically the USD is based on trust (like most fiat currencies, well almost all currencies) hence the ""In God We Trust""  _smiley_"

 The introduction of macro prudential measures around capital retention based on the level of credit & market risk inherent in assets that banks are taking on & the need for a countercyclical buffer are steps that should hopefully introduce more accountability in the banking system"
1781,"There are a number of criticisms levied against multiples, but in the main these can be summarised as:\n \n\n Simplistic: A multiple is a distillation of a great deal of information into a single number or series of numbers 
 By combining many value drivers into a point estimate, multiples may make it difficult to dis-aggregate the effect of different drivers, such as growth, on value 
 The danger is that this encourages simplistic – and possibly erroneous – interpretation.\n Static: A multiple represents a snapshot of where a firm is at a point in time, but fails to capture the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of business and competition.\n Difficulties in comparisons: Multiples are primarily used to make comparisons of relative value 
 But comparing multiples is an exacting art form, because there are so many reasons that multiples can differ, not all of which relate to true differences in value 
 For example, different accounting policies can result in diverging multiples for otherwise identical operating businesses.\n Dependence on correctly valued peers: The use of multiples only reveals patterns in relative values, not absolute values such as those obtained from discounted cash flow valuations 
 If the peer group as a whole is incorrectly valued (such as may happen during a stock market ""bubble"") then the resulting multiples will also be misvalued.\n Short-term: Multiples are based on historic data or near-term forecasts 
 Valuations based on multiples will therefore fail to capture differences in projected performance over the longer term, and will have difficulty correctly valuing cyclical industries unless somewhat subjective normalization adjustments are made"
4127,I think it was necessary
1732,I believe a smaller part could be invested in gold
2826,"The underlying assumption with multiple based valuation is that it considers the market to be efficient i.e., at any given point in time, the market reflects the fair value of the given company and any comparable firms; which is not always the case 
 Bubbles or overinflated prices in a market causes the advocates of multiple based valuers to arrive at an incorrect fair value of the company without any support from the earnings or performance parameters 
 The dot-com bubble of the early 2000s is a prime example of this phenomenon 
 The market assumed the newly formed internet companies to be holy and that it was impossible for their shares to drop in price, despite the fact that a majority of these companies were loss-making and neck deep in debt"

1925,"The assumption is that the firm being valued is itself correctly valued at the first place 
 Only then we can say that if it  had a higher P/E than the one it is being compared with, it would be deemed overvalued 
 In the case of negative earnings, I guess we would have to assume  a future positive earnings figure for that firm to do the comparison"
2113,"In my oppinion I consider to have  between 20% to 30% invested in gold un my portfolio, but the right answer, thats depend of the political situation of the goverment in my country

928,"The assumptions include the following:   That Comparable firms are in the same industry (same operating risk) and in a similar stage of development (expected growth rates) 
    When using the P/E multiple, that comparable firms have similar financing structure (financial leverage)"
6829,"The assumption we make is that comparable firms has the same value as the company we are interested in, and that all other variable are constant 
 However a number of problems might arise from this assumption 
 The value firm we pick from the market might be deceptive 
 It could be overpriced, an earlier example in the course was given how Nokia was the most bought company during the dot com rush and in-turn became highly over valued, i believe using Nokia's market price to find a fair value of another technology company would have not given a exact fair price 
 Companies that have reported a loss have a negative Net Price Value, therefore it is not advisable to invest in them 
 However companies that are comparable might still have distinctive characteristic 
 If a distinctive characteristic might be conclusively responsible for recorder loss in the comparable firm (firm A), and the company we are interested in (firm B) has an advantage we might consider purchase 
 For example, market share is an important contributor to the earnings and in turn market value of a company 
 If firm B has recently taken over some of firm A's market share, a loss in firm A a must not deter interested parties to purchase firm B"

2936,"Assumption is that when the companies have same assets then the value of that asset would also be the same of other comparable companies , in the quiz I would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies and every company have different working cost that might result in loss ( i.e negative earnings )"
532,"As we saw at the peak of the market in 2007, there were many companies that was worth invest in basing our analysis using the price to earnings ratio, but the market subsequently collapsed due to an outlier event that we could not see through our analysis 
 Also, using comparable companies doesn't take into consideration any idiosyncratic risk that may occur only in the company we are looking to invest in 
 A multiple based valuation gave us an estimate of the valuation of the company, but it should be followed by an analytical study of the economy of the sector, to see wether the industry is not going to suffer from any shortage of the commodity it uses to produce its product, and we should also look at the overall economy of that country's equity, to manage the inherent market risk"

178,"Dot com crisis showed how all same comparable companies could have unfair share price 
 Many technological companies nowadays starts as a negative earning many years, growing on investments, and still are having share value because there is a belief companies will earn after starting up 
 And in such cases the method would fail 
 Selection of right comparable set of companies could be difficult 
 Is Google early days a technological company or advertisement 
 Finally it is just an assumption that company will have similar risks as companies from same category, but in reality each company have it's unique strong and weak sides 
 So the one valued multiplier method is just a high oversimplification representing a big picture"
4433,"I believe both: it was necessary to prevent a global depression, but it clearly signaled to large banks that the government would subsidize their previous risk taking 
 In my opinion, the bailout should have been coupled with stronger regulation to prevent a similar situation in the future, but I don't believe this really happened"
6508,"I do not believe in a perfect economic system and for me any economy can have a systemic fault within itself 
 ""Invisible hand"" that governs the markets can also create problems for the markets and I do not think  that they should be left still uncheck if the economic crisis goes catastrophic 
 If we have a concept like ""too big to fail"" already, it is not much if the government purchases assets in a time of emergency to reactivate the capital flow 
 At the end, hard times demand hard measures 
 Yet, there is this dilemma in the economic system 
 In a system where the big institutions tend to get bigger, more people depend on their existence as their gravity increases everywhere in the market 
 At that point, employment, investment, economic growth and production depend too much on them, hence governments cannot ignore their fall 
 Yet, in a free market, governments cannot intervene with their operations in order to curb their profits, growths or investment 
 At the end, most of the things depend on the central banks and such government measures as mentioned in the title 
 I see it in this way: should governments do something when private sector needs support or should they left to go through a natural selection or the survival of the fittest"
1847,"\n\n\n    What could that assumption be 
 The assumption is that all peer companies should be valued at a similar level 
 If there were to be an asset overvaluation, this would inflate horizontally to all companies in this asset class (i.e 
 The valuation peers)      Were there instances in history where you would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies 
 Emerging markets (almost any time), periods of asset inflation (now, pre-2008, 1999 etc.)\n    What about companies that just reported a loss (i.e 
 Negative earnings) 
  Not use multiples valuation or change multiples (i.e 
 For real estate negative earnings means almost nothing)

3470,"Well 
 There have been quite a few instances where companies have manipulated their accounting information to achieve various goals like tax evasion, hiding losses etc. This tells us that the various multiples available could nt be authentic every time 
 For eg 
 During the dot com bubble, NOKIA was having an P/E of 100. Also enron never showed any losses in their books due to which their multiples couldn't capture the reality of the business 
 Therefore, before using any multiple, we should verify its authenticity.\n"

 In P/E multiple the earnings per share is subject differences in accounting rules and capital structures between companies hence becoming less effective 
 Also not all multiples are based on earning and cash flow driver"
7627,"Just to answer the questions raised: 1 
 The assumption made (contrary to what was explained by our guest lecturers) when using the multiples method is that managements and strategies adopted are interchangeable from one company publicly traded on the market to another 
 That is certainly not true 
 2 
 And 3 
 I would not feel confident in using this method only as it reflects the reaction of the market to the yield, and might be disconnected from the fundamental situation of the company"
1251,"The assumption most likely relates to (1) the risks faced by the companies being compared and (2) whether the company is fairly valued by the market 
 I would be wary of using this method in bubbles like the 90's tech book, when almost every company was overvalued by the market 
 Moreover, negative earnings would result in negative P/E ratios, which would not be a good indicator of the company's true value"

 Ist our portfolio homogeneous or not, i.e ist all or the major part of assets are riskful oder all or the major part of assets are riskless 
 Though the compositio of portfolio plays a great role in the decision of amount of gold to buy, there is a minimum quantity of gold that should always be keeped in the portfolio against sudden events that can't be predicted 
 So i agree with the fact to have relatively small part of gold to stomach the impact that extreme events may have on traditional assets"
1475,"If the company reported a loss, then the P/E ratio will not be available 
 Thus we may need to find some other ratios for valuation purpose 
 Also, sometimes it's difficult or nearly impossible to find any company that's similar to that to be valued 
 For example, Alphabet Inc, which is the parent company of Google Inc. It looks like there is no similar companies that could be used to evaluate the price 
 Google's income comes from online ads (more than 80%) which is on its search engine and YouTube videos 
 Another tech giant in online ads industry is Facebook 
 However, Facebook is about social network instead of web searching 
 This makes a total different company culture and decision making for these two companies 
 At the same tech area, Amazon has P/E ratio of more than 180, while Alphabet only has 30s. Even if they are in the same industry, they could be very different"

 During periods of recession you should not use P/E because the companies will probably reduce their E in the future 
 If the negative earning was caused by an specific problem on that year, we can still use P/E taking the average E from, say, 10 last years"
3465,"On one hand I believe some help to the financial sector was necessary, however I believe decisions have been made in a very unsteady environment and have been rushed, without prior consideration of other simultaneous interventions 
 Some sort of increased regulations should have been put in place at the same time and as a condition for the bail out, like the re-institution of a form of Glass-Seagall Act with the separation of commercial and investment branches of banks (maybe the one thing Trump might indeed get right. 
 ), etc. 
   In Europe, lowering interest rates without prior consideration of some regulations to enforce lending has ended up in free money for the banks and no impact on economic growth, blowing a dangerous situation of huge amounts of money ready to flood the market, with potentially heavy effects on future inflation"

745,"It is necessary that governments provide a framework for companies and civil society within which they set clear rules on how to behave 
 The government has the responsiblity to create this framework within its country and make sure all actors comply with it 
 The subprime crisis showed that the government did not provide a framework which protected consumers and other companies from reckless actors on the market 
 The Troubled Asset Relief Program was therefore an important measure to prevent the Americans from the worst 
 But the actual task of the government was then to develop a framework which would not allow again for such a crisis 
 In the following years, banks had to take responsibility for their actions and as a result, have to operate now within a much stricter regulatory framework"

 It is a way to look at it, however risk/return trade off is usually viewed in terms of the size of the risk versus the return, it depends on the investors levels of risk tolerance or risk aversion 
 For those that are risk shy, the amount of return is not their primary motivation, they are more interested in the levels of risk 
 Their ultimate question is how safe will my money be 
 Inversely those that have risk tolerance tend to focus on the levels of return first then risk later, that is what it is called a trade off. there is not ""right"" pick for everyone, it depends on your focus, goals, age etc"

 Also, we assume that the market values an entire industry properly, which could lead to errors if the latter is over/undervalued 
 In this sense, the  _domain_  bubble in the late 1990s/early 2000s is a good example of a market valuation of a sector gone wrong, with investors buying stock of overvalued IT companies because they belonged to a presumed high growth industry

 Therefore, the current situation can be ameliorated as well as the reoccurrences risk can be mitigated"
7154,"Hello, In this video, divides it up into 4 quadrants, perfection, warming, too hot, cooling, and too cold 
 He says that cooling and too cold are the worst, because it is deflation 
 But on the chart where it shows real returns, cooling is actually second best to the perfection category, meaning this is the 2nd best scenario 
 So maybe does this mean that cooling is ok, as long as its not too far into that quadrant, like a little bit of 'low inflation' and a little bit of 'low gdp growth' but not so much as to cause a deflation or to get 'too cold' 
  Thanks"

 It goes against economy development and against trust that support all the financial system 
 My second point is that the financial sector is not another sector, but it is, in my opinion, like the arteries and the veins of the economy, since this sector conducts the blood (money supply) through the entire system

 Further the general rule applies, namely that the companies should be from the same industry with the comparable financing structure.\n Using multiple-based valuation could be a bad choice, if the macroeconomic environment in a particular region changes or some unexpected policy and decisions are taken 
 Both aspects could have a significant influence on a short-term as well as a long-term ability of the companies to grow 
 Therefore the multiple-based valuation could disfigure a real value of respective companies and their stock price in the momentum of change 
 \n A similar approach applies for companies that just reported a loss 
 Although the multiples of such companies will be negatively affected in the moment they reported a loss, the constant yearly growth rate as well as future free cash flow could be very attractive

 However, each one of them is unique in many ways, though they can have similarities or sort of convergences 
 But, multiples-based valuation provides the practical tool by which you can study, compare, analyze and reach a conclusion about a company

   The actions were decisive and in a large extent worked effectively in containing the crisis and we saw a swift recovery post 2009 
 As we have learnt, stimulating a recovery / growth is much harder than cooling down the economy, the drastic measures were required to provide confidence to the markets or otherwise, it would have been much harder to claw our way out of a major crisis 
 While we recognize that some of the measures have not been rolled back, especially the unprecedented and historically low interest rate environment, I believe the central banks are waiting for the economy to stand on a stronger footing and then act to gradually increase interest rates 
 We are seeing excess and some bubbles in the equities and property markets but it is easier, as we have learnt in this course, to cool down the economy by increasing interest rates, regulating certain 'excess/bubble' sectors, restricting money flow and/or reducing/tweaking fiscal spending / policies moving forward when the economy is standing on sound footing 
 There are efforts already taken by Governments around world to specifically assist to cool down certain sectors (especially the property sector) and implement stress tests and related banking regulations to ensure Banks are on sound footing 
 I think it is a matter of time, rates will gradually rise in line with economic growth and stability 
 With the recent crisis and with previous crises, Governments are learning and innovating in their approaches to manage and prevent future crises"

 There is of course the worry that banks may feel in a certain way protected, with always a plan B in case things go wrong, in case actions taken from rogue and distracted employees would go too far; investments banks and above all rating agencies might not feel the overheating sensation that someone may feel when feeling completely responsible about what they are doing, because in the back of their head there will always be now the big plan B, the government, playing the role of the lovely parents that would help you ad support you even when you're wrong, keeping their children infantile 
 But the thing is that here we are not talking about children, we are talking about adults, grown ups that should now play the role of the parents, protecting and taking care of their clients and customers that without they would be jobless and moneyless as well 
 I'm sure that the US government would have probably came up with a better plan if it only had more time to evaluate and think about the situation; but there was the too urgent need to bail out those banks that held million of people's money, an eventual not taking action of the US government would have probably caused something close to the end of capitalism, the end of order, but in a too bad way, in a way recalling the 1929 great depression, and that may even have been the fair epilogue, but certainly not the most pleasurable"

 When we say that ""r"" increases from 10% to 12%, we mean that there are now bonds in circulation (from the same issuer as yours, the same time to maturity and face value) with a yield to maturity of 12% instead of 10% (i.e 
 With a higher coupon rate than yours) 
   The formula we see in this video and which uses duration gives you an approximation of the drop in the price of your bond now that these new bonds came into existence 
 Indeed and as we have seen in the previous video, the price of your bond must drop to remain attractive in comparison with the new bonds now available to investors 
 I hope this clears things up 
 Best regards, Jonas"

 During the early development of financial markets they were not so transparent and it would be harder to get accurate data

 Regarding companies that just reported losses, it can be both an entry point or a warning signal, it depends"
1481,"Governments were caught between two bad choices 
 Allow higher indebtedness individuals and business go bust (which would have been on a mass scale with very serious broader consequences) or embark on Quantitative Easing, which sends risky messages to banks (encourages future careless behaviour) 
  QE seems to be the lesser of two evils 
 If it is done with perfect balance (and maybe it has been overdone), future risk is reduced 
 It is also possible to regulate banks in other ways in an attempt to combat future carelessness"

6140,"I think a key assumption is that the markets are not going through a ""bubble phase"", like at the end of the nineties during the high tech boom 
 In such periods P/E ratios were VERY high and generally unrealistic 
 Companies making losses are growing (start-up, investment phase), going through a restructuring process (turnaround) or simply have a wrong cost structure; they might still be interesting for a potential buyer, but their value will depend on other factors (technology, market footprint, strategic customers or so)"

 As long as the company is growing and their is no recession, DCF should work

 DCF only seems to work for evaluating companies based on the assumption that they will always grow up to be something bigger and better"

 In addition,  there are really 7 examples (assuming we use only 50% and 100% allocations) The four given, plus shorting UM 100% as you mention, and short IC 100%, plus short IC 50%, long on UM 50%

4908,"I think the quantity of different securities is what allows for diversification and therefore lower volatility, the two different securities (ice cream and umbrellas) are not perfectly correlated , ie they do not rise and fall in value perfectly inverted from each other, there is a slight variance in how much the price of one rises compared to what the other does 
 Obviously, with a greater number of uncorrelated securities then the volatility decreases and risk is diversified 
 Or at least that is the idea unless there is hidden correlation which can lead to systemic risk, think of the credit crisis"
2247,"In my opinion, US governments should do whatever they should do keep the health of economy 
 However, I wonder, whether the bailout of precarious banks was the only choice 
 Maybe cascading effect of a bankrupt bank is overrated 
 Maybe, other tool is available such as the government takes over the ownership of the bank which will go bankrupt without a help"
1722,"The position of the US economy at the time of the GFC can be likened to that of a fire spreading through a forest 
 The Federal Reserve and US Government had many tough decisions to mark regarding which institutions to save, and which ones could not be saved 
 As more an more institutions were under threat, the risk to the remaining institutions becomes even greater 
 The task at hand was to bring the fire under control 
 This meant saving the banks as they were at the very core of the financial system, and were left 'holding the bag' when it came to providing liquidity to money market funds and asset backed commercial paper conduits that were essential to maintaining efficient credit markets 
 Had the banks not been saved, the losses of investors, pension funds and the entire economy would have been unfathomably large 
 So while some may argue that banks escaped the GFC and will likely maintain risking lending practices, the choice between that and destroying the future prospects of a generation of Americans was clear"

 Because what you could have done is bail them out in exchange for a participation in the company 
 Dont know if this could be possible but being able to take away the debt burden and being able to influence and guide the way and strategy of the company can help 
 To be honest I would have prefered the system that Island put in place where the ones responsible where trailed as with criminal charges and sentenced and the banks were allowed to collapse 
 But I dont know the economic effects of this decision in order to give a real comparison 
 I believe the TARP was a solution, maybe not the best but it was one that at the end gave considerable results"
8054,"Sure 
 It illustrates a basic concept, but we can understand basic concepts with realistic examples as well as the exaggerated one.  This ""example"" could just as easily been illustrated with using 0.7%, 0.10%, and 0.13% which is still optimistic, but much more in line with actual stock returns per month 
 Or 
 The original example could have been presented as annual returns 
 Again, optimistic, but much more reasonable 
 At the rates shown above, we would double our money about every 10 months

6089,"When one compares two similar companies, the danger lies in assuming that both companies are one and the same 
 In other words, it is dangerous to assume that what happens to one company, will also happen to the other, because they are so similar 
 This is not necessarily the case and I would think that it is especially difficult to think this way in times of economic hardship compared to a more bullish market 
 When companies report a loss, I would rather look at that company itself and try to analyze where it went wrong, rather than comparing it to another, similar firm"
493,"In my opinion, it depends on your risk tolerance and timing

5952,"I think an important assumption of multiple-based valuation method is that the company's earnings must be greater than zero, which makes it impossible to be used for some industries, e.g

 There's many differences between companies even they are in a same field, esp in the competitive market 
 So we cannot get the fair value of the prefer one based on information of comparable companies all the time 
 If the companies just reported a loss, so its spot just drop behind comparable companies, so it has no longer being the same level with the companies you just tried to compare to 
 You must find other companies with lower level to take the fair value, and that's prone to mistake"
951,"The assumption is that the market is giving the right price and thereby the right multiple

 On the other hand, gold has no intrinsic value, it doesn't pay any dividend 
 From 1986 to the present, gold increased by about 200%, while Dow Jones increased in that period of time by around 900% 
  That’s not to say you shouldn't have gold as an investment, but if you’re choosing to do so, you shouldn’t hold it as a physical investment 
 So, you should put a small percentage of your portfolio in gold for a long time frame 
 But, historically you will make more money in a 100% equity portfolio; however, if your risk tolerance doesn’t allow you to do that and you don’t want to place money in traditional bonds or other fixed income positions, gold may be a good alternative 
 So, if you still want to invest in gold it should only form a small part (around 3-10%) of your portfolio"
4282,"I I would keep an amount of my portfolio as\ngold to guarantee my income safety at all times 
 However, this percentage would\nnot be greater than the invested value in traditional assets

1808,"In a situation like this, negative earnings, considering other qualitative factors such as quality of the management, the going concern of the company, strategic policy of the company in deploying the resources of the firm, the competitive advantage of the company against their competitors should assist in decision making 
 The cause of the negative earnings can also be investigated if its an outlier performance or a systemic situation affecting the whole industry 
 This should assist in making a good decision"
6635,"From what I've learned and seen, it seems like the bailout of the financial sector was good for the economy as a whole

358,"As a financial consultant, I would never tell a client to put a large portion of anyone's wealth in gold 
 While these videos were interesting, and are very accurate,  gold is not always a perfect hedge against inflation 
 I do feel it is a good hedge against political and black swan events 
 But, looking at recent data from J.P Morgan's quarterly market review from 2000-2015, gold is not the best investment 
 Now, it is difficult to discern because gold is part of a commodity basket in this research, but commodities themselves have been the worst performing sector since 2000 
 Mostly the reason for this was from 2011- 2015 with the collapse of oil, decline in gold and silver 
 Of course gold did perform well for many years, and has performed much better than oil these past 2 years, but, it's performance still is not as good as REITs (real estate investment trust) 
  REITs averaged over 12% a year from 2000-2015 
 So, this does not mean everyone should invest in real estate, gold, small caps, etc. But a nice diversified portfolio of investments that might include gold, will perform well 
 After all, one large reason for the 2008 crisis was collapsing real estate, yet it was the best asset class to be in over the past 15 years 
 Gold did not do well in 2011 - 2015, yet there were many global political issues in this time period, especially over the past year 
 Assets will go up and down, so it is best to have a diversified basket of assets 
 Do I own gold 
 Yes, but it only makes up about 2,5% of my total net worth 
 *** Please note, I own gold coins, not an ETF or mutual fund of gold 
 I feel such products are too exposed to the overall market  swings and do not follow the actual price of gold 
 Second, I am talking about the American markets 
 How such investments would have done in Switzerland, Germany, Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Iran, etc. I do not know"
6069,"I think the costs of letting a bank fail is far too high and since it is often borne parties other than the collapsing bank itself, bailouts are necessary to prevent the fail of one bank to lead to serious damage in the economy 
 Banks are fundamental to the financial system as well as the economy 
 Their business largely depends on the trust of investors and depositors 
 Thus, in times of financial turbulence, if the depositors lose trust and believe a bank is on the verge of bankruptcy, the risk of a potential bank run is high 
 Also it could lead to mistrust among the banks and the interbank financial system could freeze as we see in the 2008/09 crisis 
 A freeze will raise serious problems for banks since a main function of a bank is to transform short term debt to long term credit 
 This maturity transformation could be seriously impaired in times of soaring or even unavailable interbank lending 
 In short, even though there are compelling arguments for NOT bailing out banks, e.g 
 The belief of ""too-big-too-fail"" could generate high incentive for banks to be careless in future and give out more subprime loans, I believe it is necessary for government to give guarantees to potentially failing banks in order to ensure the trust of depositors and investors, as well as to prevent large spillover of the damage from one bank to others"

482,"When we use ratios to value comparative companies we make the assumption that the ratios are generally applicable to that industries' segment in what we consider a normal & current business environment 
 The multiple based valuation methods should not be used when important changes have occured recently or are likely to occur in economics, politics, etc. Changes can dramatically influence the future outcome of a business so the ratios are not very useful

4716,"Assumptions using multiple based valuation are followings: 1 
 One can properly define comparable companies 
 2 
 Comparable companies have similar risk and growth profile 
 For example, PER can be stated by different way i.e 
 PER = 1 / (equity cost of capital - growth rate) 
  So, using average multiple of comparable companies means that comparable companies have similar equity cost i.e 
 Risk profile and growth rate 
 3 
 Share price converges to the average multiple of comparable companies 
 Etc. We can encounter the situation in which those assumptions cannot be appropriate 
 In the case when companies reported a loss, I tried to calculate normal earning power of evaluated companies (the company who creates loss forever cannot be sustainable as going concern, so normal earning excluding temporary setback can be positive), but such way also includes many assumption similar to DCF. In the short, all valuation including DCF and multiples is based on many assumptions about uncertain future

  In 2007 , (P/E) ratio Price increases (say from 100 to 110) but Earnings of company increases more (say from 50 to 100) so ratio of P/E decreases compare to 2004 and Investor gets more values as he has more claim on company resources, compare to 2004(Final P/E value 110/100)  
  In nutshell, Basically it is to differentiate between price you are paying and value you are getting by that  
 In 2004 Price is more but value it generate is less compare to 2007 
 It will be easy to imagine if we see it in terms of mathematical expression!"

 It was a major global crisis with painful consequences and I do not feel that are fully recovered yet. The bailout of banks was necessary to get the economy moving again and encourage bank to start lending at a level that will increase investment 
 The process vary from bank to bank, they do not have the same level of confidence and given the experience they have been through they learned to act more cautious 
 After all they also experienced major losses, a couple of them (Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers), vanished from the market like never existed, so I guess that was also a lesson to be learned the hard way for the remaining banks that no matter who you are or how powerful you might be you can be either bought or go bankrupt if you do not have your finances in order 
 There is no such thing like ""too big to fail"" although those which were considered that way if they went out of business we could have had a real depression and not a major recession 
 So, US government did the right thing and I do not think that banks assumed that that bailout will happen too soon assuming another recession is just around the corner 
 The vast majority of banks, business and investors play more prudently now and have a big cushion of (cash) reserves to be covered for the foreseeable future

 Unlike one of the statements

7707,"In the lecture, he describes two scenarios for a 1000 dollar portfolio 
 One where you own 100 of a stock and the other where you short 100.  I understand the basic point: when you lose on a long bet, you own less of the stock, when you lose on a short bet you own more 
 This seems obvious by the very nature of the bets 
 However, what I am having trouble with is how he determines what portion of your portfolio the short bet actually is 
 What I am wondering is the net value of a short is zero initially:  you borrow 100 for a stock (-100), and immediately sell it (+100) and place the money with the bank as collateral so net impact to your investments is zero 
 This assumes you are one of the lucky few that the bank would actally do this for!  So for a portfolio of 1000 dollars, he seemed to be calculating that this net zero made up 10% 
   And he only put out 900 to make up the portfolio 
 In the other case, he had to invest 1000 
 So the example seems like comparing apples to oranges in some sense 
 When I initially answered the question, I stated that the relative position in the first portfolio decreased by assuming that we made 8.88% on the 900 (+80)  portion, and lost 80% on the 100 (-80) for a end value of 980+20 = 1000 with the 10% decreasing to 2% 
   For the second one it is not so straight forward if you think about it 
 We invested 1000 in the first portfolio (I assume real cash) in the second we only put 900 real cash, and have a 100 loan for the short 
 If the short increases by 20% and our 900 investment increases by 2.22% (20 dollars) then we can take the 20 dollars and pay for the margin call and still have net value of 1000 (although total value of 1020) 
   In this case, one could consider that the net outlay for the short is still 100 and for the other part is 900 - so the relative portions do not change 
 Or you could consider the total value of 1020 and compare to 120 which gives an 11.7% increase 
 I'm sure he did not mean for us to think this hard about it - but a ""real world"" apples to apples comparison would have been more useful in my opinion 
 And this leaves me with the question - how do you compute the actual value of a short in your portfolio"
1074,"I would have a relatively small part invested in gold and try to deal with the short term impact of extreme events by gritting my teeth 
 I would actually probably prefer to have more cash than gold in my portfolio to deal with political tensions, crashes, and black swans, because that actually seems like it would be an ideal time to enter the market 
 I'm new to this though, so what would I know 
 I'll be interested to see whether my answer to this question changes when I'm done with the course"
5375,"Using multiples-based valuation assumes that other investors in the market are acting rationally and that the assumptions they made in their valuations are correct

5402,"In my opinion, the actions of the US govt

 What they have demonstrated is that the action to purchase the 'troubled assets' from financial institutions have helped the economy avert a protracted downturn 
 To prevent this action (purchase of troubled assets) from being construed as 'incentivizing' banks to be careless in their future activities and propagating reckless behaviour, the govts 
 Must place conditions upon the banks to be restructured over a period of time to correct the situation and at the same time develop an exit strategy for their (govts.) 'troubled assets' holding"
388,"I do believe that the purchase of TARP was necessary to post the US economy, nonetheless i also think that bank regulations has been to soft in order to avoid the bubbles in the financial and mortgage markets

5239,"So in my analysis, and someone correct me if i'm wrong ( 
 ): 1) Market valuation means market capitalization 
 So in other words, Price * Shares 
 If you grab the price of a world stock index (E.g 
 Vanguard total market), then you can observe total market valuation with the use of a stock index 
 It all depends on the weighting, but this question, to my idea, can be seen as true 
 2 and 3) Are obviously correct 
 With booms and bust come overvalued and undervalued (or at fair value) markets 
 But a market can always become cheaper and more expensive 
 In other words, they can always move up and down 
 This can, for instance, be viewed in the light of the P/E ratio (how much earnings do i get for the stock price I pay?) 4) Seems incorrect 
 Some companies have little earnings but still have gigantic valuations (i.e 
 Unicorns such as Whatsapp) based on potential future earnings 
 They might not make a lot of money now, but they're expected to in the future, and thus have a strong price 
 As such, the market's valuation of the company is higher than book value (what it is worth now), due to the expectation of future growth 
 Also, the market may pay more for one company's earnings than it may do for another company with similar earnings"

 In the long term, and as a decision that could be used in the future for crisis situations, its definitely a terrible decision 
 Banks have become since the 2008 sub prime crisis a risk free investment in itself 
 If they go down governments will bail them out. This will lead banks to further and further invest in more high return, high risk investments and will not translate, in my opinion, into a really economic recovery 
 Also in terms of the government annual budget is, and will be, a heavy weight to rescue a bank or several banks, slowing actually it's recovery 
 It has the benefit of assuring an enormous confidence in the financial system as the government serves as insurance"

792,"Gold is a type of insurance with a hedge against a collapsing dollar, political tension, inflation, stock market crashes and a sudden loss of trust in a fiat currency system 
 As such, (stored!) gold becomes a valuable safe haven 
 In extremely dire times, you could argue that gold has no true fundamental value in us, but retains it value as a monetary standard 
 As such, things could be bought and sold with gold, and it would be extremely valuable against other currencies (e.g 
 US dollar) 
  However given the unlikeliness of a black swan event, coupled with the opportunity cost, and given the enormous upside, it seems wise to me to invest only a small portion of capital towards gold 
 It would be hard to say what exact percentage 
 But a 5 to 10% rate, as an insurance, seems sensible"
676,"I view this as an intertemporal problem 
 I am certain that rescuing banks today in this forms yield a perverse incentive for the future because banks now know that under a big crisis (but not necessarily if only a single bank face problems) the US Government would rescue them again 
 But, in the other hand, in the face at that time of a inmediate necesity for the US banks to start lending again and clean their balance sheet, I view the government response as consistent with that situation 
 So, in sum, in think both parts of the question are interrelated and cannot take a single part as correct

 The US government had to implement some sort of bail-out of its financial sector, because otherwise there would be devastation 
 However, since this bail-out might also create bad incentives for banks, the US government should impose effective regulations on the banks, so that situations similar to the the subprime crisis do not repeat in the future 
 Of course, government interventionism through regulation will heat the debate on free vs regulated market, but IMO some degree of interventionism is necessary in order to protect the economy"

5049,"I would take a balanced stance between both sides of the argument here 
 With the US government actively seeking to boost employment and end the depression that was currently facing the American economy (cf Paul Krugman), their TARP was justified on a way to revive an economy that has slid into a severe downturn 
 Although, as prudent macro-investors, we should take the other side of the argument into account as banks should not rest on their laurels and see the Central Bank as a safety net for their careless investment behaviour 
 With increasing regulation in financial markets (such as with the Dodd-Frank Act), risky investment behaviour is becoming a declining probability in my opinion"
3488,"I believe that the US Government (and others around the World) bailout of  its financial sector plagued by troubled non-performing assets was simply necessary, because without a healthy financial sector, economic growth is impossible 
 However, the concern that this bailout somehow incentivises banks to be careless in their investment activity and risk management is not without merit 
 One way of addressing this concern is legislation mandating a certain percentage of bank profits towards a fund that can be used to repay the taxpayer and for future bailouts 
 That is bailouts are not handouts to the financial sector but loans meant to be re payed when the crisis is averted"

 3) How the resources of the company is being managed 
 By using multiple-based valuation method, we are assuming that these 3 factors are the same for both the comparable company and the company in question 
 If the comparable company made a loss due to mismanagement, it will be unfair to use it as a yardstick to evaluate other companies"

1745,"Analyzing only price to earnings would assume that past earnings is a reasonable proxy for future earnings, equally distributed for all companies in the given sample (i.e 
 Automotive companies for a country) 
  Therefore, price / earnings fails to take into account premiums or discounts for companies with stronger or lower growths, risks involved in achieving this growth or differentials presented by a specific company 
 The political turmoil in Brazil in the recent few years is a good example of a period when shares were undervalued as investors, specially foreign, would require a discount on stocks prices due to risks involved in governmental changes 
 If we consider companies reporting losses, trying to assess fair value based on just price-to-earnings would be impossible (fair value = zero) 
  In this scenario, fair value based on cash flow should be calculated either on expectations of future cash flows turning positive or enterprise value at end of operations, for instance"
5458,"An example where I would feel feel uncomfortable with ratio analysis would be, if I expect, the company I am analyzing is an outstanding one - it has innovative product, solution etc. Then comparing it with ""normal"" companies from the same field would give the results, that will be far away from reality"

  The assumption is that comparable companies tend to converge to the industrie's average ratios on the long run (which can be a wrong assumption sometimes)

 There are 3 types of companies where ratio based valuation is difficult:     - firms with negative earnings     - firms with little or no financial history (i.e 
 Startups)     - unique firms with few or no comparable firms 3 
 For companies that have negative earnings the relevant ratios are not applicable 
 There are two cases for firms that just reported a loss:     - for those who reported a loss due to a temporary situation, earnings are assumed to follow the abserved long term trend - earnings are ""normalized"" on the medium term     - for those which face long term problems a more detailed analysis is necessary taking as assumption the earnings of comparable firms or the industry average on the long run"

6993,"Hi Vishal,  Madhu Joseph from Bangalore 
 Excited to start this course"
7489,"Hi Mahmoud, Thank you for you interest and enjoyment of the course 
 You bring up a good question about leverage and borrowing costs 
 In regards to the interest rate on amounts you borrow, the example given by the instructor assumes no borrowing costs, however in the real world you do pay interest on capital 
 So, you are right that your returns would be decreased depending on the interest paid 
 These costs could be substantial, but as a proportion of total capital invested, might be a few percentage points or less 
 2 
 In regards to leverage in the example: even though you pay back the $100 you borrowed, you still have made $20 profit on your initial $100 investment which is 20% 
  Compared to not having leverage you would have made $10 on $100, which is 10% 
  Furthermore, in some financial markets and (more so for hedge funds), you can get leverage that is more than 2:1 
 For example you might get 20:1 or 100:1 
 This is where leverage takes on greater risk and reward 
 With 20:1 leverage your $100 now controls $2000 and making 10% of $2000 = $200 or $200 profit 
 In this example, you made $200 profit on a $100 investment with leverage and would have only made $10 without 
 As the instructor mentions, leverage can also amplify your losses 
 Hence, leverage-related financial crises"

 Maybe I'm wrong."
366,"In the presentation for computing NPV i was a little confuse, because the slide shows, inflows and outflows divided by the discount rate to the power of the number of periods 
 Maybe is a little silly but parenthesis were not used, so at first I asume it was just to show the period number (or cashflow number) and it didn´t have any relation to the computation 
 Meaning I just took the cashflow and divided by 1.10, then I realized something was wrong and then I noticed if they used the parenthesis I would undestand it rigth away 
 Cashflow/(discount rate) to the period number power 
 I am sorry if it´s to basic, but I´m just documenting my learning experience 
 Hope this will be usefull for someone else"
4676,"I think the assumption refers to the future earnings or profits 
 Thus, we ted to think that our company will do well in the future but it may not. And so, you are valuating a company in terms of future cash flows that may not occur 
 To the following question, yes. I think there have been times in history where the multiple-based valuation was a very unreliable method, such as the booms of the internet or the housing bubble"
754,"That both the companies would perform similarly given other variables defining performance affect both companies equally 
 Yes there could be many instances in history were multiple based valuations would not work as viariables affectin two companies would be different

5856,"One would need to look to Japan to gain insight to the question posed 
 Japanese banks were left holding an enormous number of non-performing loans after its property bust, and the Japanese economy sat in the doldrums for decades as a result 
 The US using TARP, prevented the US from following the same fate 
 In addition, by changing capital balances and instituting living wills, bad behavior by banks has been curtailed"
7559,"For example, if a company uses a P/E  ratio, and we suppose that the profit earnings are, lets say 100 in 2016, while the marketcap of that company is 3000 
 That means that the P/E ratio is 30 
 THis is quite high but consider the following: the company is growing super fast, and in 2017, we expect profit to be 300, with the same marketcap , 3000 
 This means that the P/E ratio in 2017 is only 10 
 The P/E ratio has been lower in one year due to its earnings are increasing (which means that it is cheaper) 
  This means that a P/E only teaches you something about the current situation (2016 in this example), it doesn't consider growth in the future and that's why it's not a good measure on its own"
4159,"We would assume that companies are in the same industry, so they would have the same operating risk, and we would also assume that they are in the similar stage of development, so they have similar growth rate 
 Finally, when we using P/E, we should also in addition to make sure that the companies have the similar financial structure"
8676,I would keep a relatively small part of my portfolio invested in gold
1367,"Assumption - Growth rates of both companies in future will be the same 
 Management team strength are the same 
 Neither company has any competitive advantage over each other 
 History - Evaluation tech stocks where earnings often do not reflect the reality such discounted cash flows in future are huge due to companies focusing on user acquistion first and then revenue Loss Making Companies - Need to see whether loss is because of heavy investment for future or bad performance"
2112,The assumption is that the comparable companies are fairly valued
5950,"That companies operate under similar circumstances 
 In many cases, companies in the same industry have different business models and different cost structures that can preclude an apples-to-apples comparison

 Those are very important drivers that can generate big differences in the performance of the company, in internal costs and in sales"
5106,"Yes I am worried about potential consequences of the bailout in terms of bad incentives for banks 
 Having experience firsthand the fall of a bank and a Government having to bail one out, it's a scary situation for all that I wouldn't want to see repeated again in my lifetime 
 That comfort knowing the Government will bail them out allows the Banks to engage in so much risk and in essence is no different then gamblers in a casino 
 While I do agree the Government needs to have a role in all this and not be taken out of the picture all together, they will need to create incentives strategically so that the Banks would less likely engage in this risky business"

3272,"Although using the multiple based valuation method is easier than using the DCF valuation it is very dangerous to use because it assumes the company is performing at average industry growth 
 However, in some instances, this could result in a drastic underestimation or overestimation of a company 
 For example, lets assume grocery companies were private and the data of their valuation was not publicly presented 
 If we were valuing ""Sears"" we would use a P/E ratio that was the average of the industry Sears was competing with 
 This ratio would assume that Sears performance was on par with competitors such as Walmart and Target 
 However, Sears performance is way off from this industry average and thus we would be giving investors an overvaluation of the company's true price"

964,"I would have a large part of my portfolio in gold 
 Better safe than sorry"
4015,"In my view, when valuing a company on comparable a key assumption we make is that factors that influence both the companies remains the same 
 That is the qualitative factors pertaining to the leadership are similar, both companies are in the same stage of business cycle and both companies will react similarly to external stimulants 
 One of the instance where i was not satisfied with multiple valuation is when I was valuing a IPO of a women's inner wear brand lovable lingerie (LL) 
  The comparable Page industries and Rupa & Co 
 Were mature brands with significant market share 
 Comparing the two firms was like trying to give valuation of Nokia phones to an iPhone in its early years 
 LL was a rapidly growing brand and assigning it a PE of a mature company didn't feel ideal 
 Hence, DCF valuation was the most optimum method 
 In case of negative earnings it is important to identify the source of negative earnings, if it is a one off event or recurring event, Or if the the company is still in its growth stage where its sill seeking growth in market share while compromising on its earnings 
 In the case of later, comparable metric would be ideal"

 Multiple-based valuation may not have been ideal in recessionary periods such as the GFC if you were to compare banks they may have all been similar but all would have been in some financial stress, this could have lead to an unfair valuation"

 Action has consequences 
 Normally, if you take foolish actions you will reap bad results and if you take a wise action, then you will reap the rewards of that 
 In this case, if banks take really risky bets, then the consequence is that the government will buy is it so nothing bad there happens 
 If banks make a good bets, then the banks make a lot of profit 
 This is the type of thing that make you start your own bank"

 On the other hand we have good banks and bad banks 
 At least banks with more NPL should be closed and other with better conditions can use incentives"

5799,"An important assumption underlying utilization of P/E and other multipliers in comparing different firms is that the firm under evaluation and the firm which is going to be used as a measure, are in the same stages of their life cycles 
 Consider Firm A is a firm trying to find some place for itself in the market (Take it as a soft drink producer) 
  Management is trying their best to take a share of the market however it may take a few years and up until then, level of income made stays unattractive 
 Applying the same multipliers used for firms in their maturity will result in undervaluation of the firm 
 The same deficiency will come up with firms reporting losses

 We have seen that the average rate of return on gold is around 8% over the last 45 years

 The liquidity of gold is high and it can easily be converted into cash whenever required 
 If the investor is diversified their portfolio by investing in equities as well, then the following will happen: 1 
 When the market is going up and inversely, the price of gold is falling: a 
 If the investor reorganizes their portfolio to balance their asset diversity, they should sell the equities( for a profit) and buy more gold(which will be at a low price)

 Yes there is inflation, black swans do happen, dollar can crash and there always will be some point of political instability, yet even from the graphs show in this short video’s you see that markets recover again 
 For me gold will be used for these “crash” moments 
 If i would require to cash out some of my investments for whatever reason during such a period, i would be able to use the gold in order not to touch my other investments 
 History shows that markets recover and i believe one should find a balance in investment that once crashes happens you can sit out this crash

 The market is not always rational 
 So it is wise to review company fundamentals to assess basic corporate health, and estimate earns, or at least determine the rate of return implied by the price

4595,"I definitely think it was necessary at the time as the whole country was reeling under a crisis that had the potential to increase even further 
 Since banks were able to clear off their bank sheets and get rid of their non performing assets, they were able to start lending again, thus boosting the economy

 Although it would hurt my gains when the market is good and stocks and bonds are riding really well, it would also prevent my portfolio from have even bigger losses when an extreme event happens

 If we mistake on choosing the comparable firm rightly 
 2 
 We take the current multiples which actually are in no way a representative of the future growth/decline of the firm 
 Also ,the discounted cashflow method seems to be a more useful one. the reasons are as follows: 1 
 It takes into consideration a variety of elements which help us to formulation a better and a wider view about the company on which we aim to bid. 2 
 Takind into consideration the basis of statistics, more the number to factors we take into account, the lesser will be the variation in our expected price per share"

5456,"Bailout the banks who should be responsible for the Subprime crisis should be worried about 
 Central bank should be promoting so-called Goldilocks principle and making sure the banks learnt from the crisis 
 Without any penalty, the banks would quite likely to continue playing their securitization game and seeking higher return (comes with higher risk) when the economy is recovering 
 Without a braking system, with the business cycle, the future crisis wouldn't be prevented 
 So, bailing out banks comes with a cost"
2236,"As the question itself states, gold acts as an insurance against adverse market events instead of a lucrative investment opportunity

 For a well diversified portfolio I wouldn't recommend holding more than 10% in gold either in the form of the actual commodity itself or gold etfs"
2353,"I believe that gold should be 5% of your portfolio as rather if you base it quantitatively, you should hold gold in the proportion of the volatility of your current asset class 
 So if your current portfolio has a 5% chance of a 2 standard deviation move, that should be the gold allocation"
144,"I definitely think the ""too big to fail"" notion has not been permanently fixed or clear direction provided in incase a similar crisis arises again 
 However, there has been a significant amount of goodwill lost by the banks and a general populist movement across the developed world og trying to reign in and better regulate banking activity 
 The populist component has been politicians on the right and left distancing themselves from having close links to commercial and investment banks 
 I think the banks have largely recognised this development and grudgingly accepted much of the regulation since the crisis like the Volcker rules 
 In the US, even if the Trump administration significantly loosens regulation again, I find it hard to believe that banks with take on the principle investing or proprietary risk that they once took as the next time around, there may not be enough goodwill by the population to let politicians rescue the financial markets again, even if that means short-term significant pain"

 Using this method we assume that all the company make the same decisions (investment, renewals, mergers and acquisitions etc) at the same time (this might be okay with a large sample of companies, but if a single huge company behaves differently from the average, it could bias our data) 
   If a company's got a negative earnings value, multiplying that value for the P/E of similar companies would result into a negative number 
 Share prices can't be negative or Enron investors would still be paying for their stocks"
3284,"At this time possibly it was required that the government helped with buying some of the outstanding bank debts, however I am not sure whether it was not risky for the government given that the bonds could have gone default 
 Indeed also some banks could be less careless when issuing debt and not paying back counting again on the help of the government"
4544,"Forecast for earning is hard to predict accurately, the economy cycle is uncertainty, so it's not wise to use multiples-based valuation methods"

 Firstly, the assumption that the market has valued the business correctly 
 We saw this play out in the dot-com bubble, where P/E was 60 versus an industry average of 90, is a painful mistake 
 Secondly, all valuation metrics are based on past performance, and does not account for growth

6061,"I understand risk as the probability of an event occur in the future given that it has not occurred until the present moment 
 Over my perspective risk can be positive or negative 
 For instance, positive risk of win money from lottery before having the results; and the negative risk of facing a bad weather during your vacation time only considering the forecasts 
 In addition, I have checked the glossary provided in the introductory lesson material; certainly these are more reliable than my personal understanding 
 Please see below 
 1 – According to Reuters Glossary: “The possibility that an investment or venture will make a loss or not make the returns expected 
 There are many different types of risk including basis risk, country or sovereign risk, credit risk, currency risk, economic risk, inflation risk, liquidity risk, market or systemic risk, political risk, settlement risk and translation risk.” 
  2 – According to Yahoo Glossary: “According to modern investment theory, the greater the risk you take in making an investment, the greater your return has the potential to be if the investment succeeds 
 For example, investing in a startup company carries substantial risk, since there is no guarantee that it will be profitable 
 But if it is, you’re in a position to realize a greater gain than if you had invested a similar amount in an already established company 
 As a rule of thumb, if you are unwilling to take at least some investment risk, you are likely to limit your investment return 
 For example, if you put your money into an insured bank deposit, which protects your principal, your real rate of return is unlikely to exceed inflation over an extended period.”"

2117,"One of the risks of using multiple-based valuation methods is that earnings of a given company can be a result of one-shot accident (for example selling of useless property) 
  Multiplying such ""tweaked' earnings by P/E ratio of a comparable company can simply lead to overvaluation"
4228,"It depends how much money you've got. If you're already rich and have no need to make more money in order to increase your quality of life, there is really no need to invest heavily in equities/bonds as you can simply keep a large stash  (80%) in gold while the 20% invested in stockes rakes in the cash (simply due to the volume in discussion ) 
  However, if one is poor and trying to use the markets as a way to increase cash and increase quality of life, a tiny portion (10%) seems adequate to simply hedge against a catastrauphic event/social disruption where one will simply be trying to provide basic needs to one's family"
8023,I wonder how did you come to this number (10%)

6432,"PE is Price per share/ Earnings per share 
 You don't divide again by shares outstanding 
 ""With a P/E of 20, it will take 20 years to earn enough to cover the current sale price of outstanding stock.""  This  ""adage"" really doesn't mean anything 
 What is the significance that it would take 20 years for earnings to cover the sales price 
 And it completely ignores the effect of compounding 
 Google ""price earnings ratio"" and you'' find lots of good info and explanations 
 There are lots of ratios using price 
 Price/earnings, price/sales, price/book value 
 They all attempt to measure what your investment dollars are buying 
 When a company earns a profit, it can pay a dividend with that money or put it back into the company 
 Earnings put back into the company increase its value 
 Dividends paid out decrease the company's value 
 Increased company value will increase the stock price 
 Companies use these retained earnings to buy new machinery, buildings, research and development , buying other companies,etc.  This is how Apple and Google got to where they are. Companies can earn a much higher rate of return on the retained earnings  than you could ever earn by receiving a dividend 
 They do this year after year and ""your earnings on which you didn't get as a dividend"" shows up in increased value/price of your stock 
 It compounds

1958,"In my opinion, the bail out should be done as minimum as possible, just enough to lift up the economy slightly, out of the worst condition 
 I am indeed more worried about the potential bad consequences of this bailout, knowing that the government will bail them out. It reduces the risk on reckless decision that they make 
 It would be different if they know that the government will not bail them out, i.e., they would be more unlikely to make any reckless decision"
4539,"Well the amount of gold which would be incorporated in a portfolio would depend on the type of investor 
 An aggressive investor would invest less or no amount in gold since there's an opportunity cost related to it which the investor would be not willing to have

6951,"On face value, I would place 5%-10% of my assets in gold at any given time where I feel the macro picture overall is neutral or undervalued with regards to risk assets 
 However, if I feel that risk or growth linked assets are heated and value in ie equity markets are becoming de-linked from economic and valuation fundamentals, I would slightly increase my holdings in gold to 10%-15% just as I would increase my holdings in cash, Japanese/German/US sovereign bonds and other risk-off assets"

 However, I would invest  in gold with the strategy of diversification to mitigate any unexpected risks like black swans 
 If invested in gold in large portion, then there would be risks of missing opportunity costs and decreasing the value of gold 
 If not and invested in small, there would be risks of not preparing enough for gloomy days 
 Therefore, I would like to invest in gold at a small part, but invest in government bonds and bills which are relatively low risks and low rewards"
301,Sufficient portion of the gold is reqd as in case of the extreme events investor can get advantage of gold in appropriate manner
5087,"It depends on the situation

1911,"I think that government's bad incentives are more important, because in the long run it will overcome the short term benefits"
6883,\n\nI think that this bailout will have bad consequences
5979,">What could that assumption be 
 It may be the assumption that the operational and financial risks of the company under consideration and comparable companies are the same 
 Ideally one should find several reference companies in one industry, all with the same capital value, same debt and on the same technology level, but this is barely possible, because all the companies even within the one industry are different and each of them may carry specific risk 
 Thus one has to put some conditions on the reference group of companies (e.g 
 Market cap. not bigger than 200 M and not smaller than 100 M, Debt/EBITDA < 2.0,  
 ), compute weighted average multiples over this group and hope, that this multiples will serve as an accurate enough estimate for the company under consideration 
 >Were there instances in history where you would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies 
 I think that in the case of M&A or incorporation deals the multiples may be deformed significantly (for example after the incorporation of the small company by a big company its balance value may be considered as a part of earnings of the big company) 
   >What about companies that just reported a loss (i.e 
 Negative earnings) 
   In this case one may take the multiples for the bigger time period 
 E.g 
 If a company reported a loss by the end of the year one may look on the earnings over the 5 years and consider the relevant P/E 
 Over the certain periods of time some multiples may become negative 
 My opinion is that multiples-based valuation alone is not enough because it tells us only about the past performance of a company and about the present situation, but nothing about the future prospects 
 There should be a reason why the multiples for the company differ from the average over the particular industry and a driver to eliminate this difference (end of the expensive investment program, change of the management, rise of the cost for the products of the company,  
 ) 
  One has not only to calculate the multiples but also find the reason(s) for under(over)valuation and the driver(s) for the change of the situation"
5658,When most comparable companies are overvalued in a market full of bubbles
3748,"The bailout of the financial sector was necessary in the United States in part because of the Government's influence over mortgage loans; that is the US Government backed (underwrote) many of the loans that were issued to individuals who were not credit worthy 
 When the government guarantees such loans so that more people buy houses, in turn stimulating the economy, it creates the so called bubble ( an artificially inflated sector of the economy) 
   Thus, when the overall economy slowed down and millions of homeowners defaulted on their loans the whole system came to a halt 
 So, I believe the government had a bigger role in the crisis than what has been publicized and the bailout was necessary 
 If banks are left alone to determine who to lend to and who not to lend to; the credit market will be tight and not grow very fast - as in Japan 
 We hear the same issues again, not very long after the mortgage crisis, the government wants banks to promote lending to potential home buyers as a way to stimulate the economy 
 If the government underwrites loans banks loosen the lending standards and the whole process begins to heat up all over again 
 It's not an either/or situation it's a cycle and the government needs to stay out of the underwriting business"

602,"Hi Dave, As you may have noticed, the numerator of the formula you provided is the Terminal Value as presented by Philip 
 The\n denominator in the formula you provided discounts this Terminal Value \nback to its value today 
 So basically, Philip's formula gave you the \n(value of the) Terminal Value at the end of the of the explicit forecasting horizon (i.e 
 In the future) while the formula here gives you the (value of the) Terminal Value today 
 This\n is why in Philip's example of firm valuation, the Terminal Value (equal\n to 1742 in 2020) has to be discounted along with the free cash flow \nforecast in 2020 in order to get its value today 
 To summarize, the formula you provided here gives the present value of the Terminal Value 
 I hope this helps 
 Best regards, Jonas"

4730,"As an active investor, I would always like to maximize my wealth, keeping in mind the consequences of black swan 
 I would keep at least 20% of my wealth as gold as a hedge against unforeseen consequences"
1910,"The more dynamic approach to owning Gold would be to use fundamental and technical tools to anticipate when market dynamics favor environments where Gold is likely to outperform 
 Consequently, in an environment where broad market indexes suggest overvaluation of equities or technical indicators (e.g 
 Ratio analysis) suggest that Gold could outperform a broader market (e.g 
 S&P 500), one consider an increase in Gold exposure greater than a minimum exposure (e.g 
 5%) 
   The former suggesting an equity-market decline could be on the horizon; or worse yet, a coming black-swan event due to some structural issue in the markets or secular change about to occur.\n \n Other scenarios where commodity prices have begun to move higher in earnest (particularly Crude Oil) often forewarn of coming inflation if price increases are sustained over some period of time (e.g 
 6-months) 
   Said dynamics can give one the opportunity to incrementally increase Gold exposure in anticipation of increased inflation (i.e 
 Increased prices) given upward commodity price pressures.\n \n Alternatively, as inflation abates likely due to central bank intervention (i.e 
 Raising short-term rates) and attendant strengthening in the U.S 
 Dollar that generally follows sustained actions by the Federal Reserve, one would consider reducing Gold exposure incrementally back toward a baseline portfolio amount.\n"
1511,"This question ties back to the objectives and Mandates of the Central Banks 
 The U.S Central Banks have mandates to create financial stability, promote growth and protect its currency 
 The actions taken TARP was simply the necessary ""tools"" needed to accomplish this mandate 
 As it's been proven, these tools has placed America as the only country that has come out of recession faster and stronger 
 Hence, in my view this was necessary policy to implement for the well-being of the economy as a whole and for the world in fact 
 The consequences of this decisions has forced corporations and Investors to implement stronger Corporate Governance practices and due diligence"
