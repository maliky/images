 The assumption is that all peer companies should be valued at a similar level 
 If there were to be an asset overvaluation, this would inflate horizontally to all companies in this asset class (i.e 
 The valuation peers)      Were there instances in history where you would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies 
 Emerging markets (almost any time), periods of asset inflation (now, pre-2008, 1999 etc.)\n    What about companies that just reported a loss (i.e 
 Negative earnings) 
  Not use multiples valuation or change multiples (i.e 
 For real estate negative earnings means almost nothing) 
 \n"

 That would give a negative terminal value, but I assume that is not the case"

5785,"I think it was necessary at the time 
 I am concerned about some of the potential consequences, but I feel that if it was allowed to reach even lower points, it'd take significantly longer for the economy to grow, and that too would hurt lower-income people a lot more"

3127,"First of all, the ratio applied seems to be incredibly arbitrary 
 The dotcom bubble showed ridiculous multiples until the market finally woke up and realized that there was nothing like that kind of value in the companies 
 Also, it obviously doesn't work in instances in which companies are loss making, particularly those entering new sectors 
 Amazon lost an incredible amount of money before becoming top companies in the world"
3505,"I would not put large part of my portfolio invested in gold 
 Since other financial instruments (derivatives, etc.) can be used for some of my risks, I will use limited amount of gold 
 Focusing on using insurance and derivatives for most risks (most of the portfolio) and use gold for low probability but high impact risk events is better"

4962,"Personally, I have mixed feelings about this 
 However, I must stress the fact that I do agree when people and corporations are taking unnecessary risk to generate and accumulate wealth for themselves, they should pay the consequences (High Reward = High Risk) 
  If the government is to provide ""bail-out"" solutions (using the public money), what is the incentive for these people to stop taking the unnecessary risk 
 The problem here is the US government (in this case) is trying to manipulate the mechanism of the ""invisible hand"" by providing exit solutions to those impacted 
 The US government bailout programmes can ultimately cause issues with the National debt level, speed up the next bubble economy, and perhaps from the ethical point of view where inequality is obvious in the US but the government rather spend money to bail out the elite class"
6268,"I currently have a fairly long investment horizon (approx 20 years) so would take a relatively smaller proportion of gold in the expectation that I still have time to recover much of the loss associated with a black swan event

3243,"Lauren, Dave I agree with Dave 
 NPV is a theme that many people face problems and the information in the course is a bit superficial 
 I learned that people in general have difficulties with NPV in other Coursera MOOCs about finance.\n I'm quite familiar with NPV so I faced not much problem, but I saw a lot of mistakes in the Assignment 1.\n In my review, I suggest that Instructors give more information on NPV or at least inform that familiarity with NPV is a prerequisite for this course.\n Maybe referencing to the learners some good readings on NPV would be the most practical action with immediate benefits"

 From any company we need to know the cost of labor and raw materials and again it is important to know if a company makes advertisement in order to attract more customers to buy more product or a service 
 B)There were instances in history where I would not have comfortable using multiple valuation methods to value companies when companies are not similar or comparable  
  c) companies reported the lost had the following problems: - The  total cost is higher than revenue -The company does not make advertisements -The company has a problem of the quality of management  - The cost of labor and raw materials are high - The company sticks on many debts - The company does not pay dividends  - The company doesn't have a qualified staff"

 Even I had that question a couple of years ago.  I think Artem and Palash have already answered your question (great answers!) 
  However, the following article will show you the implications of printing money in a more practical manner 
 I think by now you have understood printing money is not a solution to repay the debts 
 So do you have any other options as to how a government can get rid of their debts?\n  \n"
3732,"The likes of TARP and other asset purchasing schemes like NAMA in Ireland certainly have created a moral hazard for banks 
 Although the bad loans were taken off the banks books how many of the debts/mortgages ended in foreclosures and even more interest payments for the debtors 
 And with little to negligible damage to the banks and individuals who perpetuated the sub-prime crisis (Goldman Sachs etc), which is even worse 
 It's a sort of state socialism for the rich where the banks can be essentially nationalised or bailed out with public money but if an individual fails its a completely different set of rules/consequences"
6777,"Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures 
 Moral hazard is a real issue that can skew incentive structures for banks towards taking too much risk 
 But this is a problem for when the economy is experiencing ""fair weather conditions."" It becomes a moot point when the whole financial system is facing an existential threat and there would be no banks left to stand to take any risk 
 So in the case of the financial crisis of 2008 TARP with its ultimate use to inject capital into banks was the absolute right thing to do in my view 
 The fact that it actually made money for the taxpayer while helping to avoid a second Great Depression is evidence of that"
3809,"I am more worried about the consequences of these bailouts 
 I suggests that governments can be the ""lender of last ressort"", but that fact forget that states can as well default 
 This triggers severer risks on the government bond sector 
 Further more role the the central bank is more than ambivalent 
 Who rescues them in the next crisis if the have large amounts of defaultable bond (e.g government,  
  bonds) on their books"
2937,"In my personal opinion the US government shouldn't be blamed for taking a brave action with such a short amount of time to reflect on the facts 
 There is of course the worry that banks may feel in a certain way protected, with always a plan B in case things go wrong, in case actions taken from rogue and distracted employees would go too far; investments banks and above all rating agencies might not feel the overheating sensation that someone may feel when feeling completely responsible about what they are doing, because in the back of their head there will always be now the big plan B, the government, playing the role of the lovely parents that would help you ad support you even when you're wrong, keeping their children infantile 
 But the thing is that here we are not talking about children, we are talking about adults, grown ups that should now play the role of the parents, protecting and taking care of their clients and customers that without they would be jobless and moneyless as well 
 I'm sure that the US government would have probably came up with a better plan if it only had more time to evaluate and think about the situation; but there was the too urgent need to bail out those banks that held million of people's money, an eventual not taking action of the US government would have probably caused something close to the end of capitalism, the end of order, but in a too bad way, in a way recalling the 1929 great depression, and that may even have been the fair epilogue, but certainly not the most pleasurable"
7821,"I firmly believe the bailout of its financial sector was necessary for the well being of the economy as a whole otherwise there was potential for much deeper recession than 1929 
 The economic growth in the US has been recovering\nmuch faster after the crisis was this program called TARP (Troubled Asset\nRemoval Program) TARP compare to other world economies immediately 
 Essentially,\nthe Federal Reserve bought shares of the troubled banks and gave them funds to clean\nup the balance sheet of the banks 
 This enabled banks to be very quickly back\nin the lending game at least on paper 
 In US, the Federal Reserve saw the similarity\nof recession of 1929 where the response of the banks was slow which lingered the\nrecession to 4 years (1933) 
  US central banks have also been using unconventional policies\nof quantative easing under the leadertship of Ben Barnake, who is world’s expert\nin quantative easing 
 This is when a central bank buys other assets, usually\nbonds in an effort to further reduce the borrowing costs for businesses and\nconsumers 
 This is been compared to raping up the monetary printing presses,\nthe sums of money that have been printed are vast 
 In its effort to rescue the\nUS economy the Federal Reserve bought around $3.5 trillion of assets"

1892,"I am more worried about the potential consequences 
 I strongly believe and self regulation and, if banks or other companies go bankruptcy due to inefficient management or risky operations, we will certainly have a negative impact in the economy but it should heal alone 
 As soon as governments play a central role that commonly reflects to a ""big salvation after everything went wrong"", banks, companies and individuals tend to care less about risk and about consequences of actions 
 We still have not reached big economic growth and I believe it is just a matter of time to have another (maybe bigger) financial crisis, since the one from 2007-2009 and its biggest effects were just postponed by such a program like TARP"
1182,"I think it's hard to say. I think we might have recovered from the crisis without the bailouts, but it is hard to say how long it would take and how bad the outcome would have been

 That being said, I don't know what the final consequences are going to be from the bailouts 
 Listening to the last videos, it seems that benchmarks have been altered and we are in uncharted territory"

4932,"From what I understand, to calculate the value, you use something like the P/E ratio, which tells you how much money you need to invest in order to get a single dollar of earning, i.e 
 You account for both the price of the index and the earnings per share 
 Whereas if you looked at the price of the index alone, it is just merely a number and does not tell you how valuable you investment is"
6979,Dave  You're welcome
6971,"Read up Joseph Stiglitz 
 Whole dedicated to this discussion"
6425,"When using P/E ratio for valuation, we have to assume that that the earning aspect of this ratio is not manipulated, otherwise its reliability could be questionable 
 While using P/E ratio as a valuation metric across comparable companies, we would also have to assume that these companies are within the same industry 
 As P/E ratio doesn't tell a full picture, I'll be comfortable using other valuation methods like EV/EBITDA to compliment the P/E ratio as the former includes interest EBITDA For companies the negative earnings, the P/E ratio would be e negative ratio 
 This ratio will thus be reported as are not applicable ""NA"" when earnings are reported"

3470,"Well 
 There have been quite a few instances where companies have manipulated their accounting information to achieve various goals like tax evasion, hiding losses etc. This tells us that the various multiples available could nt be authentic every time 
 For eg

 Therefore, before using any multiple, we should verify its authenticity.\n"

 I'm unable to complete the quiz 
 Please help me"
2615,"The very important assumption could be that the comparable companies are accurately valued 
 Instances in history are when there is a stock market crashed or market euphoria, where the price are not accurately reflecting the correct value of the companies 
 And these affect multiples like P/E ratios"
6003,"Hi 
 I believe the underlying or at least important assumption we make while using multiple-based methods is that the comparable group of companies are correctly valued by market 
 In the preceding quiz and lectures as well as evidence in real life confirms that companies may be either undervalued  or overvalued 
 If we consider, for example, oil and gas companies in emerging markets such as Russia and Ukraine where the state has almost a monopoly in the industry, the small cap privately owned oil and gas businesses cannot even find a proper peer group for comparison 
 The next important requirement for peers comparison is that the relevant group should be consistent in terms of revenue structure, business ""maturity"", debt or simply be alike 
 This constitutes another limitation for multiples based methods because  all the companies are different in their own way and normally our knowledge about them is based only on publicly awailable information 
 I understand that in this cours we are talking about companies who adhere to the same accounting and reporting standards such as IFRS , US GAAP, or other similar GAAPs (generally accepted accounting principles), while it may not always be the case as each country may have its own standards for financial disclosures 
 Hence , the definition of revenue and eventually profit shown by companies in a little known country may also be a subject for discrepancies with the peers in developed markets (countries) 
   The discussed in the course multiples based methods were based on current or past information as opposed to DCF method which takes into consideration future cash inflows and growth rates 
 That is in my opinion another disadvantage of multiples methods 
 Global demand for some products may change dramatically within industry 
 Again in energy sector the price for fossil fuel has dropped from 120 to below 50 usd/barrel (crude oil Brent) over past few years, the deplition of resources puts under going concern companies producers 
 While solar and renewables based energy companies are enjoying stronger growth and future demand (Tesla, Solaris, etc.) 
  Mobile phone companies: Nokia and Blackberry example of failures after years of significant growth couldn't serve as peers to Apple or Samsung (smartphones) while they seemed to be alike 
 And finally, the question about p/e for loss makers 
 Well, the purpose of any (commercial) firm is generating profits 
 The instinct says investing in loss making companies is a financial suicide 
 However if the company is undervalued due to its loss year, it's always worth to ask why there was a loss 
 And if the reason was adequate , the investment may be very well rewarded in the future 
 It often happens that company underwent some restructuring, was fined by regulator, posted impairment of assets or incurred a loss from discontinued operations 
 They not necessary lead to negative EBITDA but significantly lower it 
 Financial analysts and accountants call those adverse items as ""one-offs"" 
  One-offs do not typically happen in a due course of business but rather appear as ""black swans"" 
  In this case excluding one - offs from EBITDA or in other words -normalizing EBITDA-  may give us another more accurate picture on the value of the company 
 Best regards, Oleksandr"
1018,"I would rather have a limited amount of gold in my portfolio, just as much to cover my worst losses, in case that happen 
 I feel that by doing so I also manage to make reasonable returns by investing in other markets"
3140,"Short answer - It was a necessary evil 
 On one hand, near economic standstill compelled unconventional monetary policies like TARP 
 On the other hand, it created dangerous precedence by condoning and possibly incentivizing ineptitude on part of the largest financial institutions in the US 
 This was particular evident when TARP recipients went ahead and issued millions worth of executive bonuses 
 Ideally, the bail-out should have come with a caveat where TARP recipients would have to adhere to stringent banking regulations which forecast and prepare for such contingencies in future"
1788,I have to think more on this subject
7424,"I could have a relatively large part of my portfolio invested in gold as an insurance to protect it against 'black swans' events 
 If i assume a future crisis in financial markets and to be simple i've my money only invested in equities i could have a portfolio structure like 70% in equities and 30% in gold 
 As gold is commonly inversely correlated to equities,in theory a big drop of 20% in equities will be related to a 20% gain by gold 
 I compute it: 0.8*70(equities)+1.2*30(gold) = 92 i lose only 8% of my portfolio in this case"

485,"In my opinion, the bailout done by the US government to their financial sector was a necessary think to do, but indeed gives bad incentives for the banks 
 The lack of regulation to their financial sector, made US Banks commit bad decisions

940,"The P/E ratio assumes that the past is indicative of the future 
 It also assumes that the earnings are correctly estimated"
2969,"The assumption is that the multiples are not overvalueted or undervaluated 
 In a bubble the multiples can be very high 
 But it could be the increase of earnings in one sector 
 Other consideration is that earnings could be the result of short term drivers 
 For instance, the costs of an aquisition 
 In both cases, there are a distortion, that can be better evaluated with a DCF"
1246,"I would have a small component of Gold in my portfolio but increase or reduce to hedge against certain market forces such as inflation,stock market crushes,risk of war or under performing dollar"
4086,"No 
 The role of gold is hedging 
 Therefore, I keep the amount of gold proper to hedge the risks of equity, bonds and also substantially against black swan"
3457,"Well, the assumptions could be related to an existence of an outlier company (for either good or bad results) 
  This could of course bring some fake expectations to market value, leading investors to put their money in the wrong assets 
 Such behaviors can always be observed in times that come before the financial bubbles 
 In those cases in which the company just has reported a loss, this specific company could bring pessimism to the market"
2064,"In doing this, some key issues would have to be taken into consideration 
 There is need to find comparable listed companies,compute ratio of market value of earnings and infer the value of the firm that one is interested in 
 Also, in choosing the multiples the firm needs to be in the same industry and at similar stage of development 
 And in using the P/E multiple, the firms should have similar financing structure 
 There are assumptions and also factors that could affect the method 
 The macroeconomic conditions, policy decisions, valuation and technical options all greatly impact this"

7782,"If the company just reported a loss maybe we can take the expected earnings for next year 
 Or compare the previous year"
6187,"You can't always assume one year is going to be comparable to the next in terms of relative increase or decrease in growth 
 Things happen 
 Wars break out, lawsuits are filed, products may have unforeseen flaws etc. If a company just reported negative earnings, the important thing to look at is the underlying reasons for that 
 Are they being outcompeted by a superior product 
 Are rates for their services changing in the market 
 Or is it a presumed one -time loss"
9009,"Because there are multiple variables that play a factor in the process of  evaluating a company

2239,"On hindsight, it was probably more correct than wrong that the US government started with its' bailout program 
 Otherwise, it would have spark off the global great depression 
 Of course there will be potential consequences such as giving banks the thinking that the government will always bail them out in times of need 
 However, this has since been tighten with the government coming up with tougher checks and rules for the banks to comply with, failure of which, they will face hefty fines which will be detrimental to their balance sheets 
 With the bailout, it has spark off more lending and a recovery of the global economy, which goes a long way to show that it was the correct decision by the US government"
20,"Since gold, like other investments, fluctuates in value, it is not feasible to keep a large portfolio of gold

2345,"Sample size big, current earnings represent a fair non-volatile view 
 The sample of comparable companies chosen represent a fair sample of equally challenged companies"
818,"The principle assumption we make when using ratios observed in the market to value a company is that the market is pricing the company correctly - i.e 
 It is acting irrationally 
 It is clear that there are times when this does not happen 
 For example, I would be uncomfortable relying on multiple-based valuation methods when valuing technology stocks in 1999 or 2000 at the height of the dot com bubble 
 Indeed, it is impossible to use earning ratios to value a company which has reported a loss"
3512,"It was necessary but there should have been more constraints for the Banks and more accountability 
 Fraudulent behaviour is unfortunately still happening today"
2502,"The assumption we make in using industry multiples to judge value is that those ""similar"" companies are themselves fairly priced 
 This was a disastrous strategy during periods of euphoria such as the dot com bubble of the late 20th century 
 Generally speaking, companies with consistently negative earnings are not suitable for the risk profile of the everyday investor and are usually funded through VC and other private ventures 
 If I company has posted a loss in just its most recent earning period, then there are other metrics that can be employed such as price/earnings 5 year average or even price/book value"
6905,"I don't invest in gold because I think it doesn't have the same value in term of currency as before

3252,"The major assumption made when valuing a company share through multiples is that the risk involving in both the companies is equivalent 
 It basically gives an approximate idea of the company's fair evaluation, in such specific cases DCF method must be preferred"
4396,The comparable companies must have a price that correctly reflects their value
3944,I am more worried about the final consequences of  all this process
2036,"In cases where the market as a whole is undervalued or overvalued, the method of comparing multiples breaks down 
 Moreover, an extreme performance of the valuated company on the current year that might well not be representative of the general trend would bias significantly the conclusions,"
8415,Relatively small part
4910,"I would think that it depends on the time frame of my investment 
 I would calculate the probability of a extreme event and the compute how much risk is not to invest in gold and find out a tolerable risk for my taste"

2986,"By using ratios comparing companies, we assume that the comparable companies are trading at fair value 
 Which might not be the case, e.g 
 In bubbles like before the  _domain_  crisis 
 Using DCF valuation - even with its inherent assumptions - will give an indication of the fair value of the company independent of the market"
6946,I would probably want around 10% of my portfolio invested in gold because it's enought to buffer some unexpected event that may occur
8764,"I would take my chances and only allocate a small portion 
 If a true catastrophe happens hopefully the price of gold will skyrocket so high that it will help offset the small proportion 
 After all, the question above does specifically refer to disasterous events"
2797,"The prices in the market are affected not just by company fundamentals, but also external factors like the political climate, and ""fads"" that might create asset ""bubbles"" 
  For example the housing bubble that precipitated the 2008 market crash 
 If a company reports a loss, you should consider the factors that created the loss - was it something affecting the entire industry 
 Was it a one-time write off? or is there a fundamental issue"
8172,"Yes, in 1987, years 2000 and subsequently 2008 due to foreseen or unforeseen incidents some companies took on losses due to the systemic market declines, however due to factors like sector, management etc. 
  they may still have been more valuable long term investments than the market would have suggested at the time"
2569,"In case there is a bubble on the market like the dotcom boom i dont think this valuation would really correctly show the value of the company - it may show an ""actual value"" which might be very high but it wouldnt reflect the real value of the company has.  As the all other companies would have a high P/E it would give a high value for the observerd company as well regardless of the real value of the company 
 In case of negativ earnings it would just give a negative value for the company value so it cant be used"
4377,"I believe that the bailout due to the subprime crises was necessary to prevent a systemic crises, but it became evident the necessity of a better control of the banks's leverage and risk exposure"
1670,"I think in today's market, it is advisable to put a small percentage of one's portfolio in gold for the long term 
 Also, if someone wants to use it as a hedge against corrections (downside markets) and rebalancing takes place at key moments, then gold certainly has a place in the portfolio 
 The goal is to keep good quality investments and not try to time the market 
 Gold can be used in place of traditional bonds or other fixed income positions"
5562,"I think gold should be a part of any portfolio, but weighted more heavily heading into any periods of unrest or uncertainty with regards to political unrest, interest rates, or inflation 
 So, perhaps 5-10% of a portfolio should have gold to hedge against risk, but not so much in gold so to incur opportunity costs amiss of higher returns in equities and fixed income 
 This weighting can be shifted heading into any periods of unrest to hedge against further loss from equities and fixed income"
8673,I would have a small part of Gold since there are other other assets that I could use as a hedge against extreme events
4351,"As we learned in these Gold series of lectures that an annualized return over the past four decades was 9%, thus I would allocated 10% of my portfolio to Gold (or so called the family of precious metals) as a safe hedge"

6,"When using multiple-based valuation we assume that different companies will behave the similarly in the future which does not have to be the case 
 We assume that they are in the simmilar phase of development and thath their growth will be simmilar in the future 
 But many things might go wrong along the way so we cannot just look on multiples and base our conclusions only on those"
5932,"Ratios assume the quality of management, future prospects, and so on are all about the same across the companies used for comparison 
 Also immediate investor reaction of positive and negative news may result in excessive optimism or pessimism about the company's value"
4534,It may look as an bad incentive but at that moment it was a necessary step to avoid catastrophic consequences of the crisis
8215,"I can understand some of the frustrations 
 You do need to be careful with the maths especially if using a calculator 
 It is easy to make mistakes and rounding errors can also affect the results

 ""You are contemplating the following project: buying 1 share today at 35 USD"" What following project 
 And what has the share price got to do with the NPV of this 'mysterious' project 
 If it means the project at Q1 (Also confusing as Q1 is not a question but just requires the radio button to be ticked to score!) then presumably the benefits are the cashflows 
 But what are the costs as there is no upfront expenditure 
 I'm not looking for the answer here but I would appreciate some insight into the method 
 Finally while I'm in whine mode  _smiley_  I agree with other students that have expressed the expectation that the tutors will provide answer sheets for the assignments complete with workings-out where relevant, as it represents a significant learning opportunity"
4591,"It was necessary to reach the short term goal of the government, preventing the economy from a recession 
 It should be assumed that the US government put this program into place as a rare exception to prevent bigger damage and will not repeat this any time in the future, as everybody should be aware of the high need for discipline in the finance/investment/banking ecosystem"
2168,I'm concerned about the consequences of the bailout as this is completely uncharted territory
5582,"Multiples-based valuation methods should only be used if there are indeed comparable companies in the market 
 Several other factors play a part as well, such as: area of operations, financial structure, stage of the company, product mix etc etc and finding a suitable match might not always be the easiest task 
 A possible way around this could perhaps estimate where the company in question, for example a tech company, currently is on the growth cycle (early, mid, mature) 
  For early and high growth potential companies, we could utilise say, the 75th percentile P/E multiple as it would illustrate more accurately the potential growth story of the company in question - one which is more risky in nature but potential upside is highly possible and thus, investors would be willing to pay more to reap out-sized capital gains in the future"
4705,"Given the real hedge benefits that gold brings, I would hold a portion of gold in a portfolio, but only in the same proportion that I would any other asset"
1611,"Despite its benefits as a hedge, I have a hard time believing in the case for investing in a non-productive asset 
 Perhaps it sounds a bit theoretical but I look much more favorably on exposure to the ingenuity of modern society through capital markets than investing in something that has purely notional value 
 I vote for holding zero gold and stomaching the drops"
2410,"When we use ratios observed on the market, we make an assumption that the market correctly values the stock prices of the compared set of companies 
 However, the companies considered may be undervalued or overvalued (the dot com bubble)    PE valuation methodology cannot be used to value companies whose earnings are negative 
 - companies may have short- term / temporary problems resulting in negative earnings that do not reflect the potential of their business to evolve in the future 
 - new projects/ companies are likely to generate negative earnings initially but represent a huge potential in the future"
2785,"Bailout is essential at that point

1224,"The bailout was definitely necessary to brake the negative spiral which could potentially erase capitalism 
 Unfortunately, doing so, the governments have become way to implicated and their weight in the financial markets is nowadays to high 
 It will certainly take a long time until markets will behave in a more natural way again"
3904,"Multiples based valuation methods are based on following assumptions: (1) Management of companies under comparison have similar performance capabilities, which is not the case always 
 Many a times, financial results of the companies depend on management performances 
 (2) Multiples based valuation methods ignore the analysis of company's balance sheet, which is often important in determining future and financial health of the company"

3422,"I would think that a more accurate approach would be to both look at the DCF method as well as multiple-based valuation methods in order to determine the fair value of a stock 
 This is to test assumptions as well as the value of comparable companies 
 In doing so, we are able to take into account certain factors which may be isolated in nature such as companies within the same industries reporting a loss 
 On the flipside, we are able to test our growth rate assumptions and see if the outcome will be consistent from the of multiple - based valuation methods"

 It has an opportunity cost"
3240,"I think banks should be punished

620,"Bankers are incentivized to make money 
 Inevitably, their actions expose the economy to the kind of breakdown we saw in October 
 With new regulations on their behavior, future crises will no doubt look different, but they will not be eliminated 
 The only way to avert crises is to treat banking in the same way we treat polluters: Create an environment that internalizes the negative externalities banking activity generates 
 That is, we should give bankers incentives so that they do not want to engage in the kind of risk taking that exposes the whole economy to a meltdown"
5589,Is undervaluation/overvaluation intentional or is it a consequence of prevailing market conditions
1733,"I believe the bail out was required to prevent a major financial catastrophe in the US that would have had a far more significant global impact 
 Since the bailout, US banks appear to be much better capitalized and in a stronger position to handle future financial upsets 
 I believe that political policy in the US was a contributing factor in the housing bubble which triggered the financial crisis 
 Policy makers need to be more cognizant of the legislation and signals they send to the financial markets and how it impacts the economy 
 Another issue is judicial use of debt and maintaining a balanced budget"
5697,Government can remove those illiquid assets at high discount rate to prevent banks taking advanage of bailout program

 This will maybe result in slower economic growth but al least it will be more stable"
6261,"The natural consequences of poor corporate behaviour has no played out and those that where part of creating the problem have not had to wear the full cost of the business practices and corporate behaviour 
 You could argue that the corporations and the highly rewarded employees of those corporations have been rewarded for such behaviour 
 The Governments have steps in to avoid the average worker from feeling the full brunt of this problem through even worse economic conditions that could have prevailed 
 The Government in effect has helped the banks to ensure the average citizen does not suffer more than they could help 
 You could also argue that the problem has been delayed and that the next time there is a economic situation of the scale of 2008, everyone citizen will wear the pain because the governments finances will be in a weakened position and  be in such a will be less able to use further monetary policy to stimulate the economy"
5089,"The main assumption is that the companies are in fact comparable, and that they have behaved and will continue to behave in the same fashion 
 This irons out all the inherent differences there are between competing companies in the same market 
 As one example given the different managerial team they can react to external influences very differently, for example and technological advancement, one may chose to incorporate where the other might decide that to be futile 
 This may lead to very different outcomes

5508,"As it was stated in the beginning gold can serve as a hedge against extreme events 
 I personally wouldn't consider gold as a tool to yield something out of it 
 Mainly it can be considered as a saving account 
 With that said I would diversify my portfolio in a way that gold would take small part but enough for me to overcome the outcomes of an unlikely extreme event as an individual 
 In general it all depends on the investor's strategy 
 Bigger returns come with bigger risks and vice versa 
 If investor wants to play safe then the portion of gold in his portfolio will be bigger comparing to the one who bears risk"

2860,"It seems like the US government's initiative was indeed necessary and helped to recover the economy

144,"I definitely think the ""too big to fail"" notion has not been permanently fixed or clear direction provided in incase a similar crisis arises again 
 However, there has been a significant amount of goodwill lost by the banks and a general populist movement across the developed world og trying to reign in and better regulate banking activity 
 The populist component has been politicians on the right and left distancing themselves from having close links to commercial and investment banks 
 I think the banks have largely recognised this development and grudgingly accepted much of the regulation since the crisis like the Volcker rules 
 In the US, even if the Trump administration significantly loosens regulation again, I find it hard to believe that banks with take on the principle investing or proprietary risk that they once took as the next time around, there may not be enough goodwill by the population to let politicians rescue the financial markets again, even if that means short-term significant pain"
4697,-Similar financial structure -Do not use if: Price-to-earning: Existence of debt EV/EBITDA: Negative earning
9175,"Yes, I think it was necessary, because otherwise - ordinary people are the ones who would be affected by the recession 
 Bad incentives are also present, however, Central Banks must be very clear that this bail out is only a last resort, so that this will not be abused"
4803,"The bailout itself was necessary to avoid additional damage to the over economic system, though more strict rules (including guiding incentives) should have been implemented by the policymakers at the same time 
 In this sense CBs went out of their comfort-zone to create an accomodating environment for a re-energence of a normal or any growth, while governments often failed to implement the lessons learned as laws and regulations to avoid repeating the past mistakes"

3995,"We assume that this ratio is true for both companies despite difference management and stages 
 Instances where the industry is unstable and different companies in similar stages of development are consistently underperforming may prove that a ratio may not be effective in determining long-term results as short term results are both uncertain"
2654,"The assumption would be that the future performance matches past performance 
 I would think that at any point when there is a significant movement in the market (ie, a ""step function""), it would not be possible to use multiple-based valuations as the response by each company to the shift in the environment is likely to be drastically different 
 The ""step function"" could also be introduced due to the introduction of a technology, business process, etc that is vastly different than what was known before 
 For example, the introduction of the iPhone likely made it impossible to evaluate Apple 
 But now that most companies have produced a smartphone, the multiples-based valuation method can now be applied 
 Not sure why negative earnings might invalidate this method"

3924,"When using the multiples-based valuation method, we assume that the comparable firms are within the same industry (same operating risk) and in similar stages of development (same expected growth rates) 
  When using the P/E ratio, we also assume comparable firms have similar financing structure 
 While it can be difficult to ascertain a lot of this information without knowledge of both companies,  the industry field, and a bit of additional research, the multiples-based valuation method should only be used in instances when this information is known 
 If you don't know whether a firm is truly comparable or not, you already know this will be a weak approach 
 Furthermore, the multiples-based valuation method assumes a fair value market comparison 
 However, markets do not often reflect a fair market value in the short term - stocks fluctuate and companies can be over or undervalued based on various factors 
 Short terms loses may not reflect long term gains"
1531,"In case of DCF we tent to take simpler financial forecasts and numbers, but in case of MBV we tent to take simpler human factor and details 
 First of all, companies that looks the same and have more-less similar structure, can have different trends and different management 
 Like, company A is constantly growing during last 10 years, they have a stable high-level management team and want to introduce to market new product, and company B is falling down during last 5 years, they change management team 3 months ago, but still the capital and brand is quite power to have the same P/E 
 Or, for example, one of companies with the same P/E finally has an agreement with Chinese government and from the next year will work on this market, and the second company - does not have such 
 So, for now they both looks the same, but opportunities to growth and significantly increase earnings has only first 
 EBITDA rate is also not the best, because EBITDA is the earnings before, for example, amortization, and one of companies has new buildings and this costs is low for them, and other company, with the same EBITDA has 39-years old building of main factory and amortization for them will be more bigger, because of law restrictions to 40-years old buildings, for example 
 Or, one of companies save their money on a deposit of one bank, and other - in Apple and Alphabet shares and interest rate for both of them will be different 
 So, finally, in my opinion, multiples-based valuation method does not touch a lot of details and simplify such things like a management factor, assets of company, etc"
7452,"Hi to everyone 
 I believe that it's time to change the financial world 
 It has no sense for me to buy a bond, as a retail investor, in order to receive a  possible  return of 1-2% after 30 years 
 For example in the USA with interest rates at 0%, i don't think that is very rational to buy bonds 
 Bonds and interest rates have an inverse relationship 
 The probability that Mrs Yellen will increase the interest rates is quite high 
 So, the price of the bonds will go down 
 If you want to get involved in the bond market, just short the US treasury"

 Bailing out banks seems an appropriate policy in an exchange for more severe monitoring over their behavior by governments/ Central banks 
 Leaving banks to their own after bailing them out is the problem which in my view has its roots in politics rather than economic derives"
2923,"One assumption is that the company of reference is not in the same stage of growth, or it's share value it's iliquid, so it doesn't reflect the real value of the company"

 Although it seems reasonable ratios for different companies can be very different from average 
 It's also assumed that other companies are fairly priced which might not be the case 
 As multiplied negative values would still remain negative this method probably has to be amended 
 E/g 
 Using moving average for certain amount of periods 
 This valuation method also doesn't distinguish a nature of loss 
 It's not the same if, for example, there were loss due do buying new equipment or due to management spent all the money on increasing salaries for themselves"

4629,"The valuation is dependent on multiple factors such as a) macroeconomic factor b) nature of products & factors that may affect growth of that product c) competitive environment d) quality of management at place in the company being evaluated 
 These future indicators may impact your current valuation 
 There are other technical factors too.  When ever there has been a stockmarket bubble ( such as  Dot Com boom of 2001) these evaluation based on ratio has yielded wrong results 
 A company may report loss for variety of reason - large investment into production facility, legal impairments 
 We will need to evaluate the reason for loss and consider future outlook to inform valuation"
2422,"It actually depends on the risk appetite of the investor 
 If I were an investor I would possible invest on the stocks which gives higher return than the gold"
3272,"Although using the multiple based valuation method is easier than using the DCF valuation it is very dangerous to use because it assumes the company is performing at average industry growth 
 However, in some instances, this could result in a drastic underestimation or overestimation of a company 
 For example, lets assume grocery companies were private and the data of their valuation was not publicly presented 
 If we were valuing ""Sears"" we would use a P/E ratio that was the average of the industry Sears was competing with 
 This ratio would assume that Sears performance was on par with competitors such as Walmart and Target 
 However, Sears performance is way off from this industry average and thus we would be giving investors an overvaluation of the company's true price"

 I believe that it was somewhat necessary, but at the same time actions like that can lead to banks being careless 
 At the same time we have to think about the consequences that could have happened, if the governments hadn't had bought the assets 
 So my final answer would be, that is was necessary to help the economy at that point to gain strength, but at the same time it can lead to other crisis in the future"

5284,"While those bailouts may have seen at first that are incentives for banks to take on unnecessary and careless risk, governments on the other hand, have been placing new stricter regulation to limit banks activities and risk taking 
 All thing combined have given as a result an avoidance of a much bigger crisis at the time same time that new rules have handcuffed bank's riskiest activities and the entire financial system is stronger overall"

 The first is that the U.S 
 Government now requires banks to have a cash reserve to serve as the bank's own bailout if they were to find themselves in the same situation that caused the great recession 
 The second reason is that the U.S 
 Government requires banks to undergo a stress test regularly to measure if banks can handle financial adversities 
 Also, the U.S 
 Government is making the institutions it bailed out to pay an interest on the funds that the U.S 
 Government lent to the banks"

5005,"In my case I believe that the amount of gold that one has in the portfolio should be decided based on the risk of the investor, and the overall market panorama 
 On my case I would rather have a small part, just a cushion of gold 
 This is because I believe in the diversification of the assets; as investing most of the profatfolio in gold has its own risk and opportunity cost 
 By diversifying and investing a 10%-20% of the overall value of portfolio assets in gold, one is able to cushion and use gold as hedge 
 Either ways the precise decision should be based on the market panorama, and the type of investing strategy"

 In the 20s, for instance, it was not possible to value most internet stock because their projected growth was too high, resulting in not meaningful or negative multiples 
 Companies reporting a loss can still be valued based on multiples of EBITDA, EBIT and revenues"
1429,"1) it is hard to find a truly comparable company as there are too many factors to account for. Therefore, almost all of the multiples valuations shall be approximations to validate your analysis 2) the multiples approach takes the historical accounting information (Net Income, EBITDA, Sales, etc.) to make inferences about the fair value 
 Therefore, it makes an implicit assumption that the past is representative of the future, which is indeed a strong one. For example, if a Black-Swan-event occurs (with corresponding negative earnings), these figures will be distorted 
 So it appears that both DCF and multiples approaches make some important questionable assumptions 
 For us it would be important to be aware of them and it is crucial to back up the assumptions with some background research"

 If there is an industry / geography that is experiencing a ""bubble"" I would not use multiples-based methods, e.g

5305,"Stock investing requires careful analysis of financial data to find out the company's true worth 
 This is generally done by examining the company's profit and loss account, balance sheet and cash flow statement 
 This can be time-consuming and cumbersome 
 An easier way to find out about a company's performance is to look at its financial ratios 
 Though this is not a foolproof method, it is a good way to run a fast check on a company's health 
 For instance, a high PE indicates that the stock is either overvalued (with respect to history and/or peers) or the company's earnings are expected to grow at a fast pace 
 But one must keep in mind that companies can boost their P/E ratio by adding debt (thereby constricting equity capital) 
  Also, as future earnings estimates are subjective, it's better to use past earnings for calculating P/E ratios 
 So you need to find out the causes of the negative earnings of a company 
 The starting point in forecasting the cash flows of a company is to understand how the sales, costs, profits and cash flows of a company would develop over a long period of time, So you need to understand what are the key drivers for the company's sales 
 Those could be innovation, trends in consumption, consumers's taste 
 The costs can be influenced by the cost of raw materials, the cost of labor 
 You also need to understand how the company sit within the competitive environment, because the consumers have multiple choices 
 The quality of management and their decisions influence the company's performance 
 So, you need to take those factors together to establish the fair value of the company and to understand the short term dynamics of equities before investing in equities"

4762,"Sometimes it is difficult to find comparable companies in the same industry, stage of their growth as well as similar financing

8107,"I think they had to choose one of several difficult choices 
 Personally, I would have preferred a ¨bailout¨ of homeowners by the federal government--with taxpayer dollars--bailing out homeowners by taking over property, buying out the bank interest in the property with perhaps 25 percent of the mortgage, and then writing down the value of the property and extending new credit to the homeowner directly from the Federal Government 
 Some would argue that this would place the Federal Government into the direct mortgage business, however as the Tax Collector it can always recoup on anyone who would then default on a loan--for the rest of the person´s life 
 I do disagree with the Financial Sector bailout to the banks which is a preferred SECTOR of the economy and the people, in real terms of persons and personnel far fewer than the 330 Million residents of the country 
 The famous ¨bailout¨, actually there were several ¨bailouts¨ to banks and industries was the incorrect path, but the power structure in 2007 and 2008 favored a bailout of the rich and wealthy bankers and their friends over any kind of bailout, or direct national refinancing program to troubled homeowners 
 Instead the choice was made to let these homeowners go under by the Millions and then hand over more than a Trillion dollars in financial bailouts, 1, and 2, and Auto Industry to the corporations over the people 
 So, all in all it was a bad move 
 People STILL have not recovered 
 But the Damn Banks have 
 It is a national tragedy"

  And what I try to mean by this is the fact that any method you use will make ""a lot of assumptions over many years"" 
  So no matter what you use, it won't be perfect 
 In the end, it's a matter of perspective.\n For the little I have learned so far (and by the way the quiz went) if you feel somehow attached to the company you are trying to sell stocks, or you understand it quite well, then you should go onto DCF valuation 
 It will give you more likely a good perspective on how you perceive the future of your invested money (as assumptions come from feeling) 
  However, if you just want to know how good the market is going in general, then you should go into multiples 
 Truth lies somewhere in the middle of both perspectives"

690,"I believe both are true - the TARP in the US was necessary to forestall a total meltdown, as the banking industry is heavily consolidated and ""too big to fail"" 
  However, banks have not been held fully accountable for their risky activities, in particular the bundling of bad loans in with ""good"" loans and securitizing these loans with an inaccurate risk profile 
 Fortunately the situation is better now as banks have been required to be more heavily capitalized to better withstand shocks 
 I do like the idea of clawing back bonuses of execs who make bad decisions and defraud the public 
 It seems these people are rewarded no matter how badly they perform, or how many people they hurt 
 I do wonder if we would have been better off giving some TARP money directly to taxpayers, as many banks held onto substantial amounts of the TARP money rather than loaning it out as intended 
 Mortgage restructuring programs were also not helpful for most people who were ""underwater"" on their mortgages (i.e 
 The loan was bigger than the market value of the house) - these restructured loans were difficult to get, took months for approval, and were undercut by scam artists promising to ""help"" the process 
 The housing market is still not fully recovered - while home values have somewhat rebounded, huge numbers of foreclosures are still working their way through the system"

 Yield is simply calculated to give potential buyers a quick indication whether a bond should be bought compared to others 
 Yield is based on the present value of cash flows a bond produces 
 Given coupons and face value are not changed, you won't get the same yield as to newly issued bonds 
 Yes, the reverse case happens when interest rate is dropped 
 Just imagine that when interest rate decreases, newly issued bonds will have lower coupon rate relative to what you are holding, thus it makes your bonds relatively more attractive to investors and they have to pay higher price

 Also, if the firm has reported a ""one-off"" increase or decrease in profit, it may be necessary to adjust the profit figure when using the multiples approach 
 A multiple-based valuation approach can also be inappropriate if there are no comparable quoted companies 
 In this situation, it may be difficult to find a multiple to apply to the company's profit 
 A multiple based approach may also be inappropriate where the company is growing significantly faster or slower than the comparable quoted companies 
 I feel that an approach based on a multiple of earnings is likely to be inappropriate where a company is sacrificing profitability in order to rapidly grow its sales

 However, the point about creating an incentive for banks to be careless should not be taken lightly, and it is a very valid one. The question is, what proactive steps should the government take to ensure financial stability 
 One approach could be to do a thorough review of regulations governing banks 
 Banks play a vital role in the global economy and as such should not be allowed, by law, to take undue risks 
 There is an obvious precedent for this:  while US banks were reeling near bankruptcy in 2009, Canadian banks seemed to barely notice a financial crisis was in the making 
 None required bailouts and Canada emerged from the crisis with only a minor recession 
 Why?  In part because Canadian banking laws prohibit banks from participating in overly aggressive financial engineering (synthetic CDOs, etc) 
   Mortgage loans require proper down payments and employment verification, as they should 
 Somehow, US banks were left to figure these out for themselves,  with the result that they took on way too much risks while seemingly not caring who they lent money to 
 Too much regulation often causes red tape and inefficiencies in an economy 
 I'm not proposing to add regulations, but rather review those in place and implement the right kind of regulations so banks are required to play their proper role of providing financial liquidity and stability in a countries' economy"

1901,"I believe that government's bailout of its financial sector was indeed necessary, because otherwise countries would have very high unemployment and very low growth as banks would not be ready and able to lend as they did before 
 The fact that governments saved and bailed out certain banks and big companies does not mean that they will do it again 
 Especially because now they have more experience in dealing with such problems and they are able to see how those companies and banks, that were bailed out, are behaving 
 Are they again taking too much risks, or they are more cautions now"
4187,"Thank-you, now I better understand some of the differences between between gold  other precious metals  and mining stocks and the asset class of gold as related to currencies and commodities 
 So, I think it is important to hedge against inflation, dollar weakness and unforeseen ""Black Swan"" events so it makes sense to hold a reasonable amount of Gold within a portfolio as a currency- like asset 
 Seeing how the price of gold does also rise and fall, it is not without its risks and that would make be wary of holding too large an amount of gold or any other asset class within a portfolio 
 I just wonder about some future challenges to the status of Gold with new asset classes such as cryptocurrencies, which seem themselves to be volatile enough for investors to seek a more stable hedge"
2309,"(English is not my natural language, so I apologize in advance)

 The bailout is good for the overall society so the mass do not suffer from the actions of a few. The bad actors in the financial world needed to be cleaned out so they don't have a chance to repeat their behaviors as well as serving a warning across the bow for the financial institutions that they are accountable to everyone and weight their decisions to avoid short cuts or self enriching practices"

1462,"To value a company, we know that the fair value of shares at market value adjustment of cash flow of the firm to this day. But this is not enough for us to take valuate and ratios e.g 
 Sales, costs, cash flows, P/E, you also have to put everything in the bottle, besides the ratios such as consumer tastes that are changeing day by day, you also have to add other components as much as the quality of management teams that are responsible for future decisions that the firm probably is going to make today 
 Thus, to value a company we should do not to make assumptions or produce insufficient analysis because if we buy a stock, we are buying long-term value which is opposed to a short term, in that case if need a short term we can invest at other investments e.g 
 A bank deposit

4820,"From simply an efficient or rational economic point of view, this seems like the correct and necessary thing to do as banks or financial institutions play a very important role in the functioning economy 
 However, one needs to question the premise of wanting the economy to recover fast, as to how fast 
 Why recover fast 
 These same banks were created at some point in the past when the economy already existed(I understand times are different but the market has, is and will always be the market and will regulate itself) so if the current financial institutions fail and come to an end, then by the efficient market or rational economy principle, much better and efficient financial institutions must come into existence 
 After all we need efficient markets which depends on reliable financial institutions 
 If one were to look at this from Behavioral Economics, then we again see that there are more disadvantages(in the long term) to wanting to recover the economy fast than actually seeking to let the market plays its role 
 Because we are once again not taking into account the role human behavior plays in a market and rather procrastinating this inclusion into the market for the future 
 Humans will always be humans whether the market is rational or not rational 
 We can't afford to keep repeating the same mistakes simply because we need a quick fix solution"

 On the other hand it can certainly be argued that this action of the central bank does not reflect good about its policies of properly incentivizing its banks but the fact that they have been able to avoid another great depression in the US (albeit by means of unconventional policies that include quantitative easing)  it can well be said that a major economic disaster to the world has been averted"

 Furthermore, since the cash flows are equal on the left and on the right of the equilibrium, then having received his capital by year 4 let's say, he will have to receive on year 5 his capital+ a coupon 
 This means that in 5 years he will have a sum of capital(coupons until equilibrium)+capital(year 5 return)+a coupon(year 5 coupon) = 2 capital + a coupon 
 So he will more than double his investments

 Tesla has negative earnings and free cash flows which are projected to stay negative given its CoGS, S&GA and R&D spending which add up to more than sales for next five years 
 Thus discounting negative FCF isn't possible, and putting a WACC on uncertain capital structure doesn't make sense either 
 So we settled for comparables 
 However, finding a comparable to Tesla both across space (geographically) and time (historically) isn't easy either 
 It is both a technology company (batteries and PV) as well as an Auto manufacturer

4074,"After seeing the videos on gold and formally learning how it can be used to hedge against fortuitous events, I think having gold as part of one's portfolio is an important insurance that a prudent investor should not under-estimate nor overlook 
 If I were to decide on how much of my portfolio should be invested in gold, I will probably invest in gold only at the optimal level, or the level where you balance the benefits of holding gold as a hedge vis-a-vis the cost of gold investments (both opportunity and carrying cost) 
   Although I acknowledge the difficulty of determining this optimal level due to the difficulty of predicting extreme events that have a negative impact on the performance of alternative investment options, I also believe that it is important to consider the concept of risk and return in making these decisions 
 The risk in this case is the happening of an extreme event that will have an adverse effect on non-gold investments, whereas the return is the interest and/or gain that one will earn when investing in traditional assets 
 In the end, I think there should be a balance, extreme events are highly unlikely (although not impossible) and the number of their occurrence are few and far in between, so might as well take some risk and rake the returns, anyway, in the event that black swans happen, at least the returns you earned during the good times will somehow offset the impact of the negative extreme events 
 In conclusion, I will put a small portion of my portfolio in gold investments as hedge but not too much as to forego the gains of holding other investments and/or assets"

952,"Since banks play a crucial role in the economy, it is only necessary for the government to bail these ailing banks back into recovery 
 And because banks have a vital role to play, they should be treated differently from the rest of the industries (i.e automotive and manufacturing) 
   However, bailouts should not be used as an easy way out to rescue banks but as a last resort to bring balance in the financial ecosystem

3838,"I've been reading a very interesting book from James Rickards, he is the  editor of the newsletter Strategic Intelligence in the US and has worked for CIA and the Pentagon  
  He says to invest in gold in this moment because the US nowadays has one of the highest debts in the world, the FED wants inflation (It has already tried with quantitative  easing w/out success) but the country is near deflation 
 Gold is a safe harbor and historically has overvalued in situations like that 
 But he says to invest in physical gold not in Structured Operations Certificates for eg"
2957,Only Stock markets
3985,"What we are talking about here is simply moral hazard, or the lack therein of bank policies 
 Looked at logically, there is no incentive for banks to moderate or indeed change any part of their lending practices 
 However, lending was never the issue for the so-called Great Recession 
 In fact, the depression from which we are still recovering was a result of the lack of segmentation in the Retail and Investment banking arms 
 What does this mean 
 The Great Depression was caused by massive speculative investment mania by ordinary citizens being allowed to borrow on margin into a roaring bull market where underlying value was detached from price of stocks 
 This inevitably led to a bubble or massive proportions and a resulting crash 
 However, many banks and lenders were allowed to go to the wall 
 Whilst some commentators believe that this was the root cause of the impact and sharp decline in the stock market value, the recovery was also relatively quick lasting approximately 3 years from start to finish 
 By contrast, because no banks were allowed to fail other than Lehman Brothers which was used an example of the systemic failure that could occur if other investment banks were allowed to go bust, this allowed the banking leaders (and root cause of the overvaluation of the housing market) to petition for TARP funding from the US government to the tune of $700 million in the first instance and much more subsequently as described in the previous video 
 Essentially, the government with the aid of Hank Paulson to justify the massive bail out of private banks with public money 
 It is worth remembering that government does not have any money other than through borrowing (bond market) or tax receipts, i.e 
 The earnings of private citizens and to a lesser extent companies who tend to offshore their earnings in tax friendly jurisdictions 
 So this is what is meant by Moral Hazard 
 Nothing other than the inefficient Dodd-Frank bill has been put in place to prevent a repeat of the Great Recession in the next couple of years 
 However, the bust this time will be much greater a) because the original debt has not been cleared by allowing banks to go bust and b) because the banks now believe that however they choose to make money they will be back-stopped by the tax payer - privatizing the profits and socializing the losses 
 In contrast, the Glass-Steagall act was introduced at the end of the Great Depression to separate Investment and Retail banking arms thereby preventing excessive risk taking by the speculation activity of Investment banks from adversely affecting the 'real economy' i.e 
 Business lending and private debt creation 
 The last part of this act was repealed by Clinton in 1999 under massive lobbying from the larger banks and this allowed the creation of banking monoliths such as Citigroup (so-called 'Too Big to Fail' institutions)and also the creation of extremely exotic synthetic investment products such as CDO's, securitized mortgages, virtualized securitized mortgage backed securities underwritten by the ratings agencies who were at once employed and expected to be dispassionate about the risk involved in producing these products which no-one actually understood 
 The cross-selling and  mixing of these products by investment banks meant that no-one understood exactly what assets belonged to whom, leading to a loss of confidence and so-called Credit Crunch when banks refused to lend to each without exorbitant inter-bank lending rates 
 The Central banks were then called upon to act as the lender of last resort which in this instance was the correct approach as the actual situation at the end of 2008 was much more serious than that in 1929 
 This would have been an effective strategy only in so far as it allowed risky assets to be disposed of and bank balance sheets brought under control reducing the leverage from in some cases up to 40:1 down to more historically manageable levels, perhaps around 9:1 
 This unhappily has not happened, and the opportunity has been lost to achieve this aim. This means that the bank balance sheets are in poor shape as they were and consumers are likewise carrying huge burdens of debt 
 Growth levels have been weak because of this and in fact despite the lowest interest rates ever recorded, there is little appetite for more debt 
 Debt is linked to growth of consumer spending in the US which has a knock-on effect for exporting economies such as the Eurozone which typically does not have the same level of private consumption"
488,"Gold is a proxy for cash but with inflation proofing abilities, therefore it would seem to make sense to hold cash in the form of gold at the same proportion that you would typically hold cash 
 There is of course a cost to liquidation of gold that may not exist with cash plus the insurance costs of holding gold 
 With that being said, I would be inclined to hold between 5 and 15% in gold depending on the global stability outlook 
 Given the current outlook I would tend towards the higher end of this estimate"
4160,"Some of the companies we are comparing with can have specifics that are not very knows and thus - putting them into different pool with the company we are evaluating 
 Comparing two companies can be a tricky exercise"
5543,"The assumption is that both company must have same financial structure and their may  be the chance that market is not representing the fair value of companies like in dotcom bubble 
 It can be used for companies that are reporting losses by using P/E ratio"
5102,Depends on market trend but I'll go with the small part of gold in my portfolio for insurance I can use options
1052,"When we use the same ratio to compare and value companies, we have to think that a company could have a different business strategy than other 
 Also, if the companies are in different countries, we have to analyze the macroeconomic cycles of the countries 
 For example, I think we should not use the multiple-based valuation method to value a company of an emerging market using a multiple of firms in Europe"
2255,It is necessary
6368,"That other companies are valued fairly 
 Bubble situations (e.g 
 _domain_ , 2008 crises)

6275,"None in the USA. Not discussed in the video of gold but discussed last week is the liquidity of the asset and the costs of the transactions 
 Gold is taxed as a collectible, not as a capital gain 
 Further, the brokers take a huge percentage cut both directions 
 Other gold-related assets such as commodity or future contracts might be considered"
3226,The companies you choose may be a bad comparison
6350,Ratios like P/E can be subject to different interpretations and not precisely that a company is undervalued
3657,"You can have in portfolio the large part of the defensive stocks

7469,As it is very clear from the lecture and few events which happened in the past we can take this gold in our portfolio till 30% or even 40% depending upon the market conditions
1373,"Particularly with recent market entrants, using the price/earnings ratio does not reflect investments the company makes towards future earnings 
 Established businesses may have a stable rate of investment and innovation that underlies assumptions about future growth, but many firms cannot be expected to seek constant returns, even if those returns are positive and growing"
6388,Comparable companies are not very similar to form an reasonable comparison
3690,"In my opinion, the issue may be with choosing the appropriate multiple for the company 
 This may also link  to measuring of risk the other company is exposed to as well 
 As we need to choose comparable company which has a similar risk 
 The question that arises in my mind and could be wrong ""what is similar risk and how similar could it be or basically what is the definition of similar or how much could that risk vary?"" It may sound wrong though"

230,"The assumption that we make when using multiples-based valuation is that the efficient-markets hypothesis is valid, therefore the price of a stock represents all available information about the company 
 However, human psychology can inflate (or deflate) the price of any stock and therefore create bubbles or severe recessions, flash crashes etc. One of those instances were it wouldn't be wise to use multiples-based valuation, would be the dotcom bubble when the P/E ratio of the NASDAQ reached a staggering 175x 
 At that time, even companies that reported negative earnings might have faced a short term drop in their share price but longer term they would still follow the overall bull trend and increase their price"

2366,"There are many occasions when multiple based valuation wouldn't be appropriate 
 For an example such an instances may include: (a) in case of valuation of a startup company that hasn't generated any cash income yet. (b) expectations of Price and Capital returns doesn't always go in the same direction or with the same pace 
 (c) P/E ratio might misleading based on how that ratio is obtained 
 For an example: if a company holds a lot of excess cash, which generate little or no income, that ratio may show an artificially inflated value 
 Therefore all non-operating assets must be excluded in obtaining the ratio 
 (d) multiple based valuation based on industry averages doesn't take into account that different companies, although in the same industry, may have different growth expectations based on the value they create"
3488,"I believe that the US Government (and others around the World) bailout of  its financial sector plagued by troubled non-performing assets was simply necessary, because without a healthy financial sector, economic growth is impossible 
 However, the concern that this bailout somehow incentivises banks to be careless in their investment activity and risk management is not without merit 
 One way of addressing this concern is legislation mandating a certain percentage of bank profits towards a fund that can be used to repay the taxpayer and for future bailouts

 Purchasing the assets and equity from financial institutions, the government can help the banks recover faster from economic crisis and eventually revive the economy 
 And in real life situation, this solution is still very unusual, so it won't act a bad incentive for banks"
5191,A 10% allocation of the overall portfolio into gold should be reasonable both for the purpose of asset diversification and risk mitigation
3836,"In both cases there are risk which will have to be evaluated 
 However the fact that till now the US has been recovering faster than before it proves that to a certain extend this strategy works 
 However too much of something will not give best results 
 Having a balance between the two is the answer 
 For example have a set of criteria on assets and equity from which the US government will decide on whether to purchase or not the above will provoke, in my opinion, banks on more careful investment activities in the future 
 I am not an expert neither I have a deep understanding on the subject 
 Therefore  i am not able to provided criteria examples"

4110,"I argue that the TARP program incentived banks to be careless 
 Action has consequences 
 Normally, if you take foolish actions you will reap bad results and if you take a wise action, then you will reap the rewards of that

 If banks make a good bets, then the banks make a lot of profit 
 This is the type of thing that make you start your own bank"

 Multiple based valuation method is not always used because choosing a multiple is a crucial step for this process

 If these factors are miscalculated or taken for granted, it would lead to wrong benchmarking and wrong assurance to the investor as to the value of an equity, be it overvalued or undervalued"

256,"In my opinion, since gold is inversely related to the stock market, thus when the stock market is performing well, gold will be performing purely 
 Thus, when the times are good we need to be performing well, so I believe that at any time the largest part of one's money should be allocated in diversified equities and bonds 
 This doesn't mean that we shouldn't give the necessary attention to the insurance gold gives us 
 When the stock market failed in 2008 the price of gold skyrocketed, reaching 2000 USD/ounce 
 That means that even a small fraction of our money in gold can have a satisfying outcome 
 So I believe that it should range around 10%- 20% pf one's portfolio

1507,"Dear Mr 
 Hoesli, You have mentioned that investments in RE are usually a good hedge from inflation 
 I would like to challenge this statements based on the data from recent RE price development in Russia 
 In Russia we recently faced a number of factors: international sanctions and oil price shock led to increased outflow of capital from Russia which resulted in increased demand for foreign currency and substantial devaluation of Russian ruble 
 Devaluation led to increased prices of imported products and to increased prices of domestic products as well, since domestic producers decided that they can increase prices and still remain competitive in comparison to imports 
 As a result, inflation in the country increased sharply 
 In such a situation it could be logical to assume that if someone invested in real estate in Russia before all these events, she could be ptotected from inflation 
 However, what we witnessed in RE market after those events is that due to all these factors the purchasing power of Russian citizens decreased, since their daily expenses increased, so their demand for RE investments decreased as well 
 Thus, not only the prices of RE assets have not been adjusted for devaluation, they fell even in RUR terms together with rental payments, which also fell 
 Thus, for example, owners of flats, which let them for rent, not only were unprotected from inflation, but were hit by it and their investments decreased in value 
 Here is a short article about the RE price movements in Russia:    So, it seems that when hedge is mostly needed during the time when inflation jumps, RE investments do not protect from it 
 Thank you in advance for your feedback 
 Kind regards, Ilya"
3626,"That's a good question, and I would wager that my ""correct"" answer would depend on where I am in life 
 If I'm a *young* person and therefore able to weather market volatility, I would imagine I would probably take a smaller position (on gold) and therefore have the potential to realize greater returns by investing in equity markets 
 If, however, I am closer to retirement age and unwilling to stomach volatility, or am simply less risk averse, I would probably take a larger position [on gold]"

1790,"I personally would invest a relatively small part just as insurance but would take the chances on investing in traditional assets that provide greater returns 
 I live with the mindset that return should come in the short term rather then waiting for something that may never occur in the long term"
1819,"I think, after the crisis it was important to bring the trust back in the banking institutions   
  Without the TARP it would have been nearly impossible for financial institutions to trust each other for borrowing and lending 
 The economy could have come to a virtual standstill 
 What TARP did was to make  banks honestly cleanup there books and get back on their feet 
 There have been stronger regulatory norms post crisis which should keep a check on Banks so that they do not overstep again 
 Credibility is the Key in finance and banks know that if they repeat the same mistake it will be end of the road of private banks and goverments might start taking control of them"
1402,"Using the multiples of comparable companies assumes that the other companies are fairly valued 
 However, there are times when the the stock market as a whole is overvalued, or when particular industries are overvalued; at those times  would not feel comfortable using the multiple-based valuation methods 
 In the case of companies that just reported a loss, other ratios such as P/B or P/S can be used 
 Still, the loss has to be considered as well, in comparison to what there companies are doing"
4597,"I would have gold constitute a small part of my portfolio since in normal times (no black swan) gold will act as nothing more than insurance yielding very little returns 
 However, it will be useful over time as the business cycle brings recessions and other types of crises 
 In that way my reserve of gold will avoid me losing all of my investments"
6002,"Although FED´s quantitative easing programmes prevented what would potentially be a second great depression, it has created 2 more dangerous problems for the long term 
 It has incentivized banks to be less afraid of going bankrupt and taking more risks (that will increase systemic risk) and it has increased income inequality in the US (the election of a populist president is probably a consequence of that)"
6555,"The main assumption is that current prices, and therefore ratios, are reflecting the fair value of the comparable companies 
 This is not always the case, as there may be many times where the general level of the stock market or a sector is over- or undervalued 
 Therefore, using only a comparables valuation will skew your results in the direction of the market 
 In my opinion, another reason not to use comparables is that the market´s assumptions and forecasts (on FCF, WACC and growth rate) may be different from your own, giving you a valuation that might no be in line with your view of the company´s proyections 
 If a company just reported a loss, using P/E ratio comparable would give you a negative valuation 
 But the company may have had a bad year, due to temporary factors, and in the next years it could produce high returns that are not being taken into consideration in the multiples method"
3672,"The assumption is that the two companies which are compared must have similar financial structure, and industrial structure 
 That is, it isn't feasible to compare a chemical industry with an IT Firm"
393,"That's a very good question indeed 
 Probably for simplicity they chose to use the simple average instead of the compounded return 
 Another assumption could be that one doesn't have access to the return at that point (the position has not be liquidated) hence it cannot be reinvested and hence the simple average is more appropriate"
1953,"The first key is to compare only companies that lie in the same industry, however, you can't rely only on ratios as you have to includes other factors to have a better view of the company 
 I don't have real experience in valuating companies as I'm learning to do so, and therefore I can only say that, again, valuation method should rely on the industry you are looking into 
 Companies who reports loss, should not be necessarily rejected, because there may be other risks such as nature catastrophes, political tensions, regulations, company management changes, etc"
5681,"I think the key is to strike the right balance and always have a sufficient portion in gold and even silver for that matter 
 In the last couple of years there has been a risr in bullion sellers who offer vault storage services to ensure that physical gold is backed for everybgram of gold purchased"
1503,"Assumptions maybe: the financial structure of the company we want to value will not change dramatically in a short term 
 I come up with no ideas about the instances since it is my first time to learn something about financial markets

5798,I never had any investment in gold
5474,"The bail out of the financial sector was necessary 
 Our world would not of have been able to survive another Great Depression 
 However, the government should be expected to provide another bail out for banks careless and lucrative investment activities 
 Big banks must be watched more carefully now, but I do think TARP was necessary in 2008"
2136,"The assumption is that the companies are in fact similar enough to be good reference points for each other 
 We need to keep in mind that each company, no matter how similar at first glance, are unique in that they are run by different management team, offer slightly different niche in the market, and at somewhat different stage in their life 
 For example, both Google and Yahoo are search engine companies but their earnings and outlooks are very different"

2544,"I believe there are four scenarios/ reasons when multiples based valuation methods don't give a fair valuation of a company 
 1 
 When an entire industry is overvalued 
 This leads to multiples that are inaccurate 
 For example in the tech bubble in the early 2000s 
 Tech companies were all overvalued and hence multiples based valuation would give inaccurate valuations 
 2 
 When a company straddles two industries 
 For example uber 
 It is diifculy to place it in one particular industry 
 As it is part of the tech industry as well as the transportation industry 
 Choosing multiplies exclusively from one industry would lead to an inaccurate valuation of this company 
 In such scenarios the multiples based valuation will not work accurately 
 3 
 Multiples based valuation methods tend to ignore the unique characteristics of companies 
 For example their competitive advantage, management teams etc. These unique characteristics could make a company perform better or worse than the companies that their multiples are based off. Hence this would lead to inaccurate valuation of a company 
 4 
 Companies that have disruptive products and disruptive business models 
 Tend to outperform companies similar to them exponentially 
 Hence companies that are disruptive cannot be valued using a generic multiple based of comparable companies in a particular industry"

3587,"The assumption when using Price to earnings ratio when valuing a company is that the company has been fairly valued 
 Past performance does not necessarily mean good future prospects, the only time I will feel comfortable using P/E ratio is if it is represented in line with growth rate of the company 
 Companies who have reported a loss of earnings but are used to having an increasing forward rate of earnings, could have reported negative earnings as an anomaly, maybe they missed estimates of earnings for one quarter 
 So they should be expected to return to their historic earnings rate"
6292,"Since the whole economy rely on the banking system it was simply a necessary move to keep the boat sailing 
 If the banks sink we all drown with them 
 How to prevent the bad incentives 
 The bank once stability is gained back, should re-buy the debt bought by the central bank, paying the accordingly interest rate 
 This was the solution used by the Chilean Central Bank in the 1982 crisis 
 Some banks are still repaying their debts"
5121,"That assumption is that the companies must be comparable in the way they are in the same industry, are in a\nsimilar stage of development and should have a similar financial\nstructure 
 It could have been uncomfortable using\nmultiple-based valuation methods to value tech companies during the\n90s just before the tech bubble burst and for the real-estate\nindustry in the milleniums before the subprime crisis 
 For companies which just report a\nnegative earnings, i think we can use the first positive average of\nthe last yearly earnings"
3088,"The example of Japan seems to demonstrate that it was beneficial, regarding bailout I think people in general don't have a long term view and it won't matter either way in 10 years time"
6379,"Multiples-based valuation methods is based on the assumptions that data from annual reports are reliable, ie without management data's manipulation, or  when digits used computation doesn't have economical meaning 
 For instance, some ratio uses net income as denominator and when it is negative will would better use ratio using EBIDTA instead"
560,"It depend on my financial goals and my current financial situation 
 If i am old with no income stream, i might put a larger portion in gold as a way to preserve my capital, although i might be losing out on dividend/interest generating assets 
 If i'm young, have income streams and can afford to lose portion of my capital, then i would take the risk by investing in high risk assets and have a small portion of gold in my portfolio"
4281,"I think bail out should be part of CB activity however to what extent to be used is debatable 
 For the U.S 
 Fed bail their bank and strengthen their economy is a must to maintain their position as no 
 1 economy worldwide 
 Think of political outcome if they haven't bail out their banks 
 Economical and political position of the U.S 
 Go together and I don't think they would sacrifice the benefit 
 Let me illustrate more, political position of US is helping their economical growth, see their chains and corporates are all over the world"
579,"Bailing out the banks bad debts has both positive and negative consequences 
 It has improved banks ability to lend additional funds thereby encouraging economic growth by taking these distressed assets/loans from the (generally private) banks balance sheets and on to public (government) balance sheets 
 A consequence of this risk shifting however is that by being able to transfer their potential losses to the public, the risk/reward balance is skewed in the banks favour, encouraging them to take greater risks with their lending and thereby creating a potential 'Moral Hazard' within the financial system 
 This can in turn lead to banking regulators increasing the banks prudential requirements, as per ""Basil III""    As with a lot of economic policy options it seems to be a 'zero sum game' at the end of the day"

2091,"I would invest the part of my portfolio in gold which I cannot afford to lose, so that part would be my saving that I cannot put any risk on 
 What I mean is that if I need a certain amount of money for necessities or future necessities, that amount should be saved in the safest way only with consideration to preserve its value against inflation, currency crises, etc. Yes, there would be an opportunity lose, but also some lower financial risks 
 At the end, my philosophy is to invest the money in the safest way by taking smart risks 
 That said, I can only play with the money that I dare to lose 
 Then, I can expect the gains and loses 
 If it is not the case, I would rather protect my savings without playing with it in riskier ways"
260,"Well, we use the multiples of other companies, but how do we know that those companies are correctly valued 
 Maybe they are grossly mispriced which would affect the valuation of our company as well"
7793,"The depression which resulted from the sub-prime crisis had a very sobering effect on banks 
 I do not wish to rely too heavily on that weakest of props, the stereotype, but most bankers are sober individuals who realize the vast responsibility over billions of dollars which they have 
 While I am not a ""classic"" economist, and am more than happy to explore the many events where too orthodox of an approach to economics has fallen down, I sense that in the lead up to the crisis of 2008 there was widespread economic amnesia 
 Many sectors of the public, and certainly more than bankers, were talking absolute rubbish ; they spoke up the arrival of a period of boom which would be like no other, and which would continue apace, holding in defiance notions of an inevitable bust 
 (Of the existence of similar types in London in 1720 or Amsterdam in the late 1630s they seemed remarkably ignorant.) I am a resident of the Irish Republic, location of a property-based ""bubble"", yet I and others were castigated as latter-day Cassandras when we advised restraint 
 But to return to the question, I think that central bankers and bankers in general, were genuinely shocked at the extent of the decline which occurred 
 They do not see future government intervention as something which they can rely on in future 
 Such intervention is equivalent to a massive vote of ""no confidence"" in the banking community, and bankers (like others) have their pride 
 There is also a new generation of central banker, typified by Mark Carney, head of the Bank of England, whose sober calmness is match by humanity"

4592,"Its a difficult question to answer 
 Banks should be coherent and responsible about their role in real economy 
 They certainly cannot be overlending illiquid money just because they know that Us government will soon purchase these assets 
 This is independent and should be treated separately to the fact that, if these is needed to boost economy and for the well being of it as a whole, then Government should definitely proceed with a so TARP program"
1796,"The earlier videos are calculating the actual returns at the end of a certain time period

 Hope this solve your question"
492,"I would rather / have a modest part invested in gold in order to hedge against any mentioned events, but not a significant part to avoid the opportunity costs / diminished overall returns

 Would be keen to know whether this is seen as a wise investment decision"

 With this in mind, we would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods in times like early 2008 
 The multiple based approach could also be difficult to be used for companies that just temporarily reported a loss as b/c that negative earning might not be a true reflection of the company's more medium to long-term performance"

2975,"During a bubble for a given industry, the P/E will raise, and so a small increase in earnings for a company would imply (in that valuation framework) a huge change in the valuation (and then the stock price) of that company, which would not be supported by anything real

4391,"It was necessary for the US government to bailout banks that had major debts during the sub prime crisis 
 It was necessary to stabilise the economy and make sure that people gain confidence in the banks and borrow money again 
 When the government gave money to these major banks like JP Morgan, Citi, Goldmansachs, Morgan Stanley and many more, they expected them to lend the money to the people, instead they kept it and didn't lead 
 This lead to the economy falling down even further 
 This is precisely the reason why these banks control trillions of dollars 
 On the other hand by bailing these banks every time some crisis occurs, would lead to carelessness of the banks 
 It is important to stabilise the economy, so the avoid carelessness and bailing out by the government central banks every time, it is important that proper regulations are made by the central bank"
6298,"Indeed the I agree the multiples methodology must be used with caution as it can be risky to assume that the market is doing a fair valuation, as always you can try to tune the ratio valuation result by getting an historical perspective, and  making sense of the present environment with the help of other ratios and indicators"

 So far no real response has arisen from developing countries and the question why deserves some reflexion"
2514,"Given the magnitude of the problem, the key was to stop the US and Global Economy from falling off a cliff 
 So I understand that given the stark choices, the US Gov't did what it had to 
 However, what troubles me is the lack of follow-through afterwards 
 As Mark Haefele said, what the US Gov't did was inadvertently increase income inequality and also raised questions about creating bad incentives 
 Has the US Gov't done more than TARP to ensure that the economy stabilized and grew for all - beyond the financial markets 
 Did the US Gov't ensure that once the situation was stabilized they placed reforms in the financial markets so that this would not happen again 
 Did the gov't ensure that the financial leaders faced high costs for helping create this nearly catastrophic situation 
 Unfortunately for all the above, the answer is a resounding no"
4813,"The way I understand it is that there is generally to less demands on the banks to return money given to them, and to less regulation of banks in the process 
 The regulation is in my opinion required in order to avoid future crises

 The fact that ""no one knew that the shit was about to hit the fan"" may suggest that the regulatory system was lagging behind a new and global economic enviroment"
3087,"You must not always use multiples-based valuation methods because market often think wrong about market valuation 
 1 
 Different sectors have different multiples 
 In Biotech P/E can be 20x but in Finance sector P/E 10x. If market think than some financial structure make innovation product or change it specialithation market can use another multiples for this company 
 Good example when company change his name to  
 Blockchain Inc. from Biotech and change his valuation without change in company 2 
 Second problem it's assumption about future of revenues in company 
 If market think that company will have GAGR 30% they are compute this future prices in presents cost 
 But future revenue is only assumption 
 That why company with negative earnings have market valuation in DCF model they haven't any valuation But this problem can be in DCF model because future cash flow is only assumption 3 
 And third problem market can be overheated 
 And average P/E or another multiples can be much higher then average historical multiples 
 It's might be bubble on market"

 Capital structure and growth prospects, allowing for a valid comparison 
 During a bullish or bearish market the price-to-earnings ratios will lead to correspondingly overvalued or undervalued estimates that will be far away for the fair valued  figures as market driven prices will be exaggerated 
 Whenever there is a loss it causes the price-to-earnings ratio to becomes negative

 This could rise to 10% during times of increased volatility and a weaker dollar 
 Currently gold is recovering from a bear market due to rising political tensions and nervous equity markets 
 The possibility that the FED won't raise rates as originally indicated may lead to a weaker dollar which in turn is good for the gold price 
 Gold serves as useful insurance in the present circumstances"
884,"Well, when the market is overvalued, using that P/E ratio multiplied by the earnings of the private company, will give us back an overvalued price per share which most likely does not represent the intrinsic or true value of that private company, but just the bullishness of the market at the time"

6624,"I believe that due to the conditions after the crisis the TARP was a necessary measure 
 The US government needed to incentive the economy by helping banks to lend money to the real economy that could be invested in new projects and incentive the economic growth 
 As we have seen in the case of japan, if this program havent been promoted, it would be very difficult to stimulate the banks to lend money to people hence no stimulation to the economy 
 If the banks are being reckless it is easier to cool down the economy by increasing the interest rates than stimulate the growth"

 Nice happy drug 
 The fear is that when we come off this drug (and we have to sometime right?) the values will do the opposite and then a lot of ordinary folks are going to get hurt."

4067,"In times of cheap borrowing costs (as at the present time) asset prices, including stock prices can all be inflated as investors seek a higher yield, creating a stock bubble, just like occurs in the property market for the same reason 
 As well as the above, in times of lower borrowing costs, companies often borrow to fund stock buy backs, and because there are less shares on the market, the earnings per share is inflated, (and funded by increased debt) putting the firm in possibly a less profitable situation ultimately 
 The dot com era was also a time when the market got way ahead of itself, and it is possible that the FANG stocks today (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) are in a similar bubble today, as the p/e ratios are extremely elevated"

 It is not a bad thing per se, experienced industry specialists can ballpark it more accurately 
 2) In periods of high volatility such as bubble bursts, the market is overwhelmed by a severe lack of trust from its stakeholders 
 Multiples can drastically vary from one day to the other or even worse, from one hour to another 
 I guess during the 2001 dotcom crisis, multiples-based valuation methods were not an effective tool to value companies present in the internet industry 
 3) Firms that just reported a loss can either be considered as an outlier and therefore be excluded from the equation 
 Or, an investor can look at the average ratio displayed by the firm 
 In my opinion, further analysis of the cash flows of a loss making company are needed 
 Reclassification of cash flows can often change the investment decision from a 'no' to a 'yes' 
  For example, if a company has accelerated the depreciation of its assets, it is possible that it also reported a loss 
 Another thing to consider is the eventuality of rapid and agressive expansion strategy of a company which would typically result in negative earnings"
8593,"I would include gold as an small part of my portfolio, let's say 4%, as insurance against extreme events in the market 
 This being part of a diversified (asset type, duration, geographic distribution, etc) that will offset as well key import investing risks"
5092,"If we use multiples-based valuation method, the important assumption we make is that the compareable companies operate in the same field would be representative for the firm we prefer 
 Tha'ts not right almost times 
 There's many differences between companies even they are in a same field, esp in the competitive market 
 So we cannot get the fair value of the prefer one based on information of comparable companies all the time 
 If the companies just reported a loss, so its spot just drop behind comparable companies, so it has no longer being the same level with the companies you just tried to compare to 
 You must find other companies with lower level to take the fair value, and that's prone to mistake"
1800,"The bailout was probably the better option since it saved the job of a lot of employees and therefore potential demand for a revival of the economy 
 What is debatable is the fact that equity owners didn't pay a single penny 
 I'm not too worried about European banks being too careless since many countermeasures have been deployed (e.g 
 Single Resolution Mechanism) 
  The US should do the same if it hasn't already"
3417,"Hi Everyone, i'm Joshua 
 Obviously, i'm a software engineer and part time position trader 
 Currently, i have 15% lost because i didn't trigger my stop loss 
 I'm very passionate about looking the chart, data and annual/quarterly report and hopefully one day, have my own data driven hedge fund 
 I'm looking forward to learn new ideas here 
 Goodluck"
4285,I would say a moderate part; as we do see that the average return is quite high at 9% YoY while it also provides you with various hedging protections
7570,I would like to invest 30% in gold and rest 70% in growth stocks
8192,"I would prefer to invest a small percentage between 5 to 10 pct. specially now that price is not that hi 
 Is a long term security"
8991,Yes
4169,"Balance sheets may be fabricated  
  leading to change in p/e ratio and a wrong answrr with multiple comparison method"
4015,"In my view, when valuing a company on comparable a key assumption we make is that factors that influence both the companies remains the same 
 That is the qualitative factors pertaining to the leadership are similar, both companies are in the same stage of business cycle and both companies will react similarly to external stimulants 
 One of the instance where i was not satisfied with multiple valuation is when I was valuing a IPO of a women's inner wear brand lovable lingerie (LL) 
  The comparable Page industries and Rupa & Co 
 Were mature brands with significant market share 
 Comparing the two firms was like trying to give valuation of Nokia phones to an iPhone in its early years 
 LL was a rapidly growing brand and assigning it a PE of a mature company didn't feel ideal 
 Hence, DCF valuation was the most optimum method 
 In case of negative earnings it is important to identify the source of negative earnings, if it is a one off event or recurring event, Or if the the company is still in its growth stage where its sill seeking growth in market share while compromising on its earnings 
 In the case of later, comparable metric would be ideal"
4969,"The subprime crisis resulted for reckless securitization of sub-prime mortage and has already taught financial institutions good lessons on financial prudence 
 It is the responsibility of the government to ensure the economy is back on its heels and the illiquid junk assets in the balance sheet of banks is going to be a drag on that effort 
 So, in the interest of the US economy and the world economy at large I think it is right for the Governments to bail out the banks and incentivize them to lend more 
 The banks are not having a free lunch either 
 The bailout comes with some stringent regulations and rules that will restrain banks from indulging in speculative and risky strategies 
 So hopefully banks will be more conscious of their practices going forward and will not put themselves in a position wherein they will seek a Government bailout 
 Apportioning the bail out funding between bond holders and shareholders rather than the taxpayers will call for more regulation of banks' practices

38,"My understanding is that gold ETF's do not actually hold the gold so much as have contract rights to the gold 
 So there is a trade off between ease of access vs the security of holding gold"
6040,We assume that every company has a constant growth rate each year
1760,"In times of a bubble when everything is over-valued, using ratios can lead to highly irrational evaluations 
 The dot com bubble is a good example of that"
2703,This method is based on the idea that assets that generate identical cash flows must have the same price  we therefore try to infer the value of a firm based on the observable market values of similar /comparable firms
3403,"I would be willing to allocate a small portion of my portfolio to gold, however, I would be hesitant 
 There are professional traders who only trade gold, and I am certainly not one of them 
 I would hate to be on the losing end of one of their trades"
9099,Yes
5480,"One of the functions of central banks is give stability to the currency 
 And I think the US government did a good job about TARP because it prevented financial institutions from dipping further into losses due to their troubled balance sheets caused by  troubled assets 
 I always believed in cutting your losses early so as to prevent greater losses and in this case 
 If the US have not done it we could have seen another 1930 crash"
7173,"Ok thanks, very helpful"
8807,Small part that adds to diversification
2287,"Since holding gold is illiquid investment, I would rather hold a relative small percentage of my portfolio in gold 
 I would treat the investment as a hedging strategy rather speculative investment"
8137,I think the problem is they only want a number so try 6047
3431,"In my portfolio, there are certain companies whose profits increase by a considerable margin every year 
 However, the stock price is not appreciating correspondingly 
 Why is this"
187,"We assume that since they are in similar industries and are at similar development stages, they also incur similar costs and earn similar revenue 
 We also assume they face similar risks 
 Thus we assume that the ratio tool we use to compare these firms are approximately of the same value 
 However, this may not always be the case 
 The  _domain_  boom may have been a wrong time to use the multiple-based valuation method especially if it was to valuate a technology company 
 There were many tech companies that emerged at that time and they were all definitely not comparable to each other, although they were from the same industry and were at similar development stages 
 Negative earnings will reflect poorly on the ratio tools being used for valuation 
 A company may have incurred a loss due to reasons specific only to that firm 
 This may not be the case with all other comparable firms 
 These companies with negative earnings cannot be used in multiple-based valuation"
70,"By making use of p/e ratios and other equivalent ratios we would assume that the market has valued the company at an accurate price 
 However, due to emotions markets tend to price companies at irrational prices - often too optimistic or too pessimistic 
 Therefore, investing purely based on those ratios can be risky 
 Let's take for instance the dot-com bubble 
 Companies were valuated at huge p/e ratios that did not make much - if any - sense 
 Would an investor have relied solely on using p/e ratios he/she would have been very likely to lose a lot of money"
1336,"Even tough using ratio is far more simpler than using the DCF valuation method, but when we use the DCF method we need to look thourogh trough company's book's for example: earnings, sales, costs, debt etc. and by doing that we get far more valuable information thus we create a far more detailed picture of company 
 In that situation we can make better investment decisions"
2822,"We do not cut our head when we feel headache, and even it could never be a solution either 
 We always try to alleviate it by following different ways such as taking medicine 
 Now considering this, I believe government should bailout its  major financial sectors when they are in crisis 
 Because crisis is a normal scenario in economy 
 If government does not bailout and it becomes a common act of government then people or investors may make distance from financial sectors and stop investing"
8571,Relatively small part and stomach the impact that extreme events may have on traditional assets
5884,The current price to earnings or companies that just reported a loss does not project future cash flows
2169,"It would depend on each individual investors situation, their appetite for risk, and how dependant they are on the income from their investments 
 An investor who has no need for the income generated by their investments, or the actual cash from their investments in the short term, has a much bigger appetite for risky investments, and can therefore allocate less of their portfolio to gold 
 Likewise an investor who is dependant on their investments in the short term, say someone who is retiring soon, would be better off investing more in Gold to hedge against risks in the global markets"
217,It was necessary to keep many jobs and prevent a much serious hazard for the economy in terms of a much deeper recession

8987,"I think yes,"
6527,"Definitely something had to be made in order to keep the world safe 
 In my opinion, this had to be done, but I believe it should be done with more requirements, with more demands to the banks 
 They would be bailed out but they had to keep up with government policies in other areas such as healthcare sectors"
3153,As turmoil in financial markets increased and equity markets are overvalued  a gold percentage of at least 30% in portfolio is fine
3287,"As evidenced by the faster turnaround of the US economy compared to the Eurozone, such policies were effective 
 It remains to be seen whether seeds have been sown for irresponsible behavior down the line"
4202,I would have just a small part of my portfolio invested in gold as an insurance
1388,I agree with you but I do feel playing the market is a gamble and even you think you are making choices there is never a garanti  as things can just happen as with the Baring Bank example
783,"The bailout by itself was not necessarily a bad idea 
 For the larger good of the economy and people's well being, getting things moving was critical to not have another great depression 
 But, for as much effort the government put into bailing the banks, they didn't much done in terms of prosecuting the people involved or setting stronger standards to avoid predatory lending 
 I understand white collar crimes like this are hard to prosecute, but how many of the same practices that got us into the mess in the first place are still happening and being conducted by the same people as ten years ago"

8331,"A number of things are wrong with this analysis;  to mention just two : 1 
 The Fed funds rate is not the same as the interest rate at which investors get paid; that  interest rate is determined by other factors 
 E.g 
 2004-2006 Fed funds rate went up, long term rates went down (don't take my word for it,  Alan Greenspan referred to this dichotomy as  a ""conundrum."" 2  
 "" Money printing"" is a misleading term,  really what's happening is the addition of bank reserves in an attempt to stimulate lending, i.e 
 Quantitative easing 
 These actions has not led to inflation, the banks are trying to inflate the currency but have not been successful in doing so 
 (Again, don't take my word for it--Ben Bernnake has explicitly said of QE: it's not printing money, currency in circulation has not gone up.)"

 The US economy was in free fall, with major banks failing or having to be sold off (Lehman Brothers, Bear Sterns, Washington Mutual) and even a money market fund breaking the buck 
 The bailout was necessary to keep the US from going into a depression 
 I don't believe that the bailout itself was a bad incentive 
 What WAS a bad incentive was that a) very few institutions and their officers were held to account for what happened, and b) very little regulation was put in place to keep it from happening again"

 An alternate solution should have been used where more of the bailout would be towards the regular taxpayers than the banks that were at the center of the crisis to begin with"
4857,"The answer to what portion of your assets should be allocated as gold depends upon the investors adversity to risk 
 Gold is an insurance policy and as such requires payment (opportunity cost) 
  The benefit is a potentially more stable portfolio during times of uncertainty (inflation, political risk, etc.), the cost is the loss of potential returns from the funds being allocated to higher income generating instruments 
 It is important to understand the inherent risks of certain assets, weigh your own adversity to risk, your desired financial objectives, and then balance in a pragmatic way that hedges risk at what one deems to be a reasonable price and that is congruent with said factors"

4794,"I believe the US government's bailout was necessary 
 First of all, the government did allow Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers to go down 
 The effect of a major financial collapse would have been disastrous 
 This way, the government sent a message to the banks even though some of them did not behave as expected with the money loaned to them 
 Secondly, a collapse of the US economy would have sunk the world economy with disastrous consequences 
 The great recession that followed the 2008 crisis has been felt all around the world, and one can only imagine the disastrous effects if the US government hadn't undertaken the TARP program"

3976,"Personally, I would rather hold smaller part of gold in my portfolio, and that's not because I can stomach extreme events that can affect traditional assets, but because I believe there are other useful ways to hedge and protect against those events 
 For example: Going long let's say Home Depot and going short Low's (these two are main competitors) one is protected from both market and sector risks 
 Because what ever happens either in market or sector, these two will move in the same directions 
 What you are actually doing is investing in Home Depot corporate plan and management, that they will outperform their main competitor both in good and bad times"

 If they are not able to recover the money doesn't makes a difference for them because US government at the end will help them bailout 
 So keeping tight watch and punishing bank is the only way to stop another crisis which might be more dangerous than other crisis"
6695,I'd adjust the amount of gold in my portfolio according to the situation
2061,"From the 100% of the securities that I would have in that portfolio, I would not hold a large part of Gold on it 
 Using the principle of diversification as a standard, I would invest a small part on it (not more than 15%), and search for return opportunities in other asset types 
 That way my portfolio would not be really volatile and would continue having positive returns"
4908,"I think the quantity of different securities is what allows for diversification and therefore lower volatility, the two different securities (ice cream and umbrellas) are not perfectly correlated , ie they do not rise and fall in value perfectly inverted from each other, there is a slight variance in how much the price of one rises compared to what the other does 
 Obviously, with a greater number of uncorrelated securities then the volatility decreases and risk is diversified 
 Or at least that is the idea unless there is hidden correlation which can lead to systemic risk, think of the credit crisis"

4322,"I think that an easing monetary policy after the sub-prime crisis was mandatory in order not to punish too much businesses and consumers which need obviously to borrow money to expand business activity in the former case and to buy goods or new houses in latter 
 But, on the other side, it may incentivate moral hazard, by pushing banks to adopt riskier behaviours: so, what I personally think, is that now, what the market really needs, is a stronger regulation for banks and investing institutions and less interventions by the Central Banks 
 Otherwise, the ultimate output of this trend could be the extreme manipulation of the market by Central Banks"

 Though I believe TARP was essential in avoiding economic slowdown, the long-term impact it sends to financial sector is not clear 
 If the Fed is using TARP and if economic agents assume it would do the same then they might not take proper caution to avoid such problems in the future 
 Striking the proper balance between getting proper incentives to the financial industry to avoid such risks and at the same time reducing the effects of such regulations on economic growth is a difficult question but needs to be addressed carefully"

 Ines said in the module, EM have high returns but also have high volatility (risk factor is great) 
  She mentions the use of US treasury to caclulate the Yield spread since it is much safer (less risk) 
  So when you say you have a YS of certain percentage that is +ve you can infer that the return in the local-dollar denominated market is higher than the US treasury but also can say that the volatility might/may be greater 
 Hope this helps to clear a bit of confusion you might have 
 Good luck"
3326,"I suppose that in this critical situation a bailout was inevitable as far as it could lead to greater economic crisis

 Another reason is that in case the firm is a monopoly then there is no other firms to compare it to, therefore, multiples-based valuation is not possible

943,I think the bailout prevented further damage to the economy as a whole (the greater good) and that some action was necessary to prevent economic calamity for many even if it was caused by a few.  I think the costs to the financial institutions should have been higher but do not necessarily agree that this particular incentive is the reason that they felt some since of entitlement or what encourages such behavior now

 Comparability can be affected if the management of different companies have selected different depreciation or capitalization policies 
 Some firms may have extensive executive compensation arrangements that reduce net income due to the recognition of compensation expense that other firms do not have 
 Companies reporting losses may be experiencing poor operational results, write downs due to inventory obsolescence, or asset impairments 
 The implication is that future cash flows will be significantly effected and these companies may not be comparable due to going concern issues"

469,"If your growth is greater than your cost of capital, then your equation (and hence the calculated value of your firm) will diverge, i.e 
 Go to infinity 
 The single equation we use to calculate the terminal value that has (wacc - gcf) is derived using the assumption that wacc > gcf.  Hence if that assumption is violated, then the results are meaningless 
 If you write out the first N terms of the infinite series for the value of the firm, you will see that each term grows larger instead of shrinking 
 So, you have a supposed infinitely valued firm 
 Only Google and Apple are infinitely valued (or so sometimes it appears)"

2788,\n\nI'm more worried about the potential consequences of this bailout in terms of bad ncentives for banks
1826,I would make my portfolio about 30% invested in gold and 70% invested in traditional assets or investments
3756,"The assumptions we make about companies are built over time through observation of various metrics (various ratios in the same industry) over time such as earnings, dividends, yield etc. the fact that markets are at the end of the day willing buyer willing seller and exit multiples often are based on negotiations which are impacted by sentiment and other economic factors 
 The basis upon which a deal is done is that firtsly a computational number is required and on the basis of that indication (number) other factors then determine a price  a buyer is willing to pay and hence a multiple is arrived at 
 There is always a range for valuation when valuation techniques and methods are used so i would not always use multiples bassed valuations because there is a lot of herd mentality that irrationally affects prices at certain times in the markets"
807,"I would prefer to invest a large part of my portfolio in traditiondl assets, because gold hasn't  yield as traditional assets like buildings, small business etc"

6438,"It would be hard to say what exact percentage I would invest in gold 
 However, I would invest  in gold with the strategy of diversification to mitigate any unexpected risks like black swans 
 If invested in gold in large portion, then there would be risks of missing opportunity costs and decreasing the value of gold 
 If not and invested in small, there would be risks of not preparing enough for gloomy days 
 Therefore, I would like to invest in gold at a small part, but invest in government bonds and bills which are relatively low risks and low rewards"
5171,"The significant assumption as I see it is that the market correctly values the similar firms; if not, the multiples method could be grossly incorrect 
 And certainly when companies experience a loss, which hopefully doesn't reflect likely future earnings, then any multiple based on earnings (such as a multiple of EBITDA) won't yield a relevant result"
3881,"I believe that we should be more worried about the potential consequences of the bailout in terms of bad incentives for banks

2944,"We assume that other companies are correctly valued

 Investors were so convinced to new technologies that they did not see anything strange in extremely high P/E ratios"
6793,"Sure, this 
 Kind of bailout will encourage banks to be more careless in their investment activity in the future"
871,"I would probably have a relatively small part of portfolio invested in gold, but use rebalancing so to progressively increase the quantity of gold when other investments have a high growth, and progressively decrease it when other investments have negative returns"
4122,"The P/E ratio remains same over a period of time 
 The company under evaluation fits well in the category of companies for which the P/E ratio applies

520,"If this bailout comes with changes in regulations so that the burden is on the financial sector to cover for its own misguided investments in the future, then the bailout is a one-time, necessary arm. On the contrary, if it's just a bailout and then business as usual, then indeed it becomes a bad incentive"
3879,"Also remember that an overvalued company is not necessarily a bad investment

4807,"I would think that the largest potential downside to market based ratios is the assumption that the market has fairly valuated a company/product/sector 
 The potential for miss-valuation where there is an obvious (or not obvious) bubble, then becomes extremely high 
 There are many examples of bubbles, Tulips of course, and cryptocurrencies very recently 
 I would not have assumed there existed a housing bubble, but I never personally was interested in cryptocurrencies 
 Depending on when the valuation takes place, the influence of the short term popularity, and thus market price, will have a disproportionate influence on the company's valuation with potentially huge margins of error 
 From a theoretical perspective a negative earnings report could unnecessarily lower the target companies valuation, especially if the earnings were due to operational inefficiencies or short term temporal effects impacting the public company and not the private one. From a practical perspective, though, I believe these influences are very well captured by the market and multiple comps would be used to offset the effects of any one entity"
3031,"The assumptions used to value other comparable companies could be: 1 
 They are in similar industries 2 
 They are at a similar development of growth During the 2008 Global FInancial Crisis, some companies were trading at very low multiples, despite their healthy free cash flows 
 This was essentially a reflection of lack of liquidity and/or negative investor sentiment 
 At such times, the multiples would not be a true reflection of the value of these companies / shareholder equity value, as the markets would have grossly undervalued these companies, and hence investment opportunities could have been missed 
 Companies that report losses are either at early stage or growth stage, or have massive capital improvement projects 
 As a result, using appropriate ratios for such companies is more critical in order to ascertain a fair value for these companies 
 For early / growth stage companies, perhaps Sales multiple is more relevant; for companies making capital improvement projects, EBITDA multiples are more more relevant"
6118,"I think in the short-run it was a good decision, as the problem was far worse than everyone anticipated 
 If government did not step in, it would’ve came to a Great Depression far greater and longer lasting than the one we experienced 
 Perhaps even capitalism wouldn’t have survived that.I do think that in the long-run, it takes away risk from Banks and encourage more risk-taking behavior among banks 
 If the worst case scenario is Gov bail-out and you get to collect fat bonus as long as anything besides the worst case happens, then why should anyone behave prudently"
8370,"I would go for a relatively small part, a survival amount for extreme crashes"
1375,"When using P/E to value comparable companies we assume their management team, strategies and future competitive advantage are similar 
 When the market as a whole looks overvalued, using multiples would be too risky, example: bubbles, during wars or political unrest, etc.    There are other ratios that can be used when there are negative earning, for example: ROI taking into consideration market capitalisation growth 
 Companies in early stages of development, with negative earnings, could still deliver positive returns"

 I think the dot com era (1999-2000) would be the period where multiple based valuation method would make me uncomfortable

2246,I would build a safety net in my portfolio
3261,"This question could be better phrased as, ""Do governments give bad incentives to bankers?"" Put this way, the answer clearly is yes, because we know that people most definitely respond to incentives 
 A banker who knows that his or her bad decisions could lead to the bank's failure will recognize he or she has some skin in the game, whether it be a pension plan, executive stock options, continued employment, or professional reputation 
 Remove enough of this risk of failure thus increases the odds of greater risk-taking by the bankers (hence the banks) in the future 
 Moreover, programs such as TARP penalized good actors in two ways 
 First, it kept afloat competitors whose employees had made bad decisions and thus hindered the natural ability of markets to reward those who make good decisions and punish those who make bad decisions 
 Bankruptcy is analogous to allowing natural forest fires to periodically clear out the underbrush: if you suppress all forest first, the deadwood and underbrush accumulates and, when a fire inevitably breaks out, it is far more catastrophic 
 Second, TARP deliberately forced many sound financial institutions to participate, thus given political cover for helping out failing institutions 
 This action helped fuel the popular misconception that all financial institutions were a bunch of greedy bastards who had upended the economy 
 But fueling populist resentment often leads to bad public policy, such as the illusion that the Dodd-Frank Act actually resolved the ""too big to fail"" policy when in fact it made it worse in the U.S"

 The market price might be driven by other circumstances than the companies performance (i.e 
 Central bank measures, speculation, etc.) 
  Therefore one must be careful by using this tool 
 Further companies that just reported a loss might be (heavily) undervalued do to the behavior of the buyers at the stock market"
