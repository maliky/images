5594,Hmmm I would say you need a basic understanding of investment and finance to take this course
3028,"The US bailout of its financial sector through quantitative easing was simply necessary for the well being of the economy , because post the subprime crisis conventional monetary policy and lowering interest rates was not going to stimulate growth since a lot of banks still held large proportions of non preforming assets and some lacked the sufficient capital to benefit from low interest rates 
 Though there are arguments about the effects of such unconventional policies on the future of the economy it is important to note that extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures and in the long run by avoiding a great depression type of recession the US is better positioned to deal with future crisis 
 However this does not dispel the issue of wealth inequality which I believe has to be addressed by creating new sources of wealth "
6800,"It's assumed that the market share of the two firms are same and stable which result in constant earnings 
 Or another answer could be it's assumed that the P/E is not changed over the course of next couple years"
2845,"It was a necessary evil to avoid a complete a financial meltdown 
 To use an analogy: When a fire starts and threatens to engulf your neighborhood, you call the firemen right away and  have them put it out right away 
 This is true even  if that may lead an irresponsible neighbor being a  little more careless because he knows the FD will come and put the fire out"
5822,"I don't consider gold an investment 
 For someone to use gold as an investment they would need Warren Buffet skills to 'time' or predict extreme market conditions, which nobody can time or predict 
 Gold may only be 'insurance' against disaster 
 The opportunity cost of investing that money, even in a cautious bond fund, is too high 
 A co-worker of mine bought gold (I think $10,000) in 2012 at the peak of the US gold fad/craze at $1,600 an ounce 
 I told hime not to buy gold because its price would fall to $1,200 an ounce, by my guess, after the fad faded away and people quit driving up the price of gold 
 Today an ounce of gold in $1,350 an ounce, which is after it went up after falling to my guess 
 Even Vanguard's Precious Metals and Mining Fund (VGPMX) is a true dud. After ten years the share price has fallen by half 
 Look elsewhere for a worthwhile investment, unless you or your client has a lot of money to buy gold for fun"
2613,"I think that in other circumstances this may have been detrimental in the long run, with investors and businesses having less trust in banks 
 In the short run those needing money may not mind too much, but this may have other impacts in the future"
6689,"A multiple represents a snapshot of where a firm is at a point in time, but fails to capture the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of business and competition"
538,"I believe bailout of the US financial sector was necessary as the size of the problem was systemic, most other countries would be effected  otherwise 
 But the policies to regulate the financial markets that were introduced afterwards make market participants to take more prudent decisions, which in turn will minimise the risk of market failure"
4801,"I would invest in little to no gold for my portfolio 
 I'm a strong believer in opportunity costs and the money put aside sitting in gold could be used for other investments that can produce more money while waiting for something bad to happen"
710,I think that it was necessary to prevent the bigger crisis and that what is done helped in long term view
5926,Really nothing
8125,"Loric I was just reviewing your work 
 Some points I made, if you want to discuss: (I know that based on Honor Code, we should not discuss but as beta tester I think it's fine to do that in order to have a sense if the assignments are coherent with the information we had on the lectures)  Q1- Terminal Value (in Year t+3) : I do not add the FCF at t=3 ,  then V_3 = (1+0.04)/(0.11-0.04)*407 = 6046,86 MUSD\n Q2 - P_0 = (352/1.11 + 385/1.11^2 + 6407/1.11^3 - 1000)/100 = 36.85  -  I do not discount debt 1000 on the last parcel, I do this:\n =( (352/1.11 + 385/1.11^2 + 6407/1.11^3) - 1000) / 100 = 43.14\n Q5 - companies that are comparable to XYZ have a Price/Earnings ratio of 9 
 XYZ's earnings are 400 million USD:  when using P/E, I do not discount debt of the earnings,  then value = earning * PE = 400M$*9 = 3,600 M$, then 36$ each share"
2742,"When using for example price-to-earnings ratio to value other comparable company we assume that both companies are from the same industry and that they are in the same level of development 
 It is very questionable what is the same industry 
 So we can compare companies that might look that are in the same industry, but they are very different 
 For example in the communication industry there are traditional companies which are still in the business with the landline phones, and there are modern companies like Skype with much higher company value, so comparing these two types of companies would be very wrong 
 Reporting a loss could only be a short term condition, otherwise that company would be shut down-in other words if there is a loss, there must be taken longer period for comparison (average earnings)"
7821,"I firmly believe the bailout of its financial sector was necessary for the well being of the economy as a whole otherwise there was potential for much deeper recession than 1929 
 The economic growth in the US has been recovering\nmuch faster after the crisis was this program called TARP (Troubled Asset\nRemoval Program) TARP compare to other world economies immediately 
 Essentially,\nthe Federal Reserve bought shares of the troubled banks and gave them funds to clean\nup the balance sheet of the banks 
 This enabled banks to be very quickly back\nin the lending game at least on paper 
 In US, the Federal Reserve saw the similarity\nof recession of 1929 where the response of the banks was slow which lingered the\nrecession to 4 years (1933) 
  US central banks have also been using unconventional policies\nof quantative easing under the leadertship of Ben Barnake, who is world’s expert\nin quantative easing 
 This is when a central bank buys other assets, usually\nbonds in an effort to further reduce the borrowing costs for businesses and\nconsumers 
 This is been compared to raping up the monetary printing presses,\nthe sums of money that have been printed are vast 
 In its effort to rescue the\nUS economy the Federal Reserve bought around $3.5 trillion of assets"
7376,"How do you solve number 7 please

2144,"Why not always use multiples-based valuation methods 
 In my opinion this method can woks well when we need to calculate the Valuation of a Company that have somes others like it in the Market 
 But sometimes we will find situations that the company we can calculate doesn't have any other like it on the market., in others words if the Market Share that the company we are calculating is not diversify, we cant find data for use. We need to known both methods to use conform the situation and the company that we are using"
5271,"I can think of many assumptions that are made 
 I.e 
 That earnings may be manipulated to look better or vary due to tax reasons for example 
 SImilarly, I also think that we would likely assume the current earnings is a representative that companys earnings, but what about next year"
4293,"It seems to me that the government's action helped to solve a problem, but may have by doing so created another problem 
 I would say that the results for the US economy were worthwghile"
7328,Very interesting
990,"The denominator is based on accounting numbers 
 This assumes the firm uses standard accounting practices 
 There have been multiple instances of accounting fraud, which would have resulted in investors buying shares in what they thought would have been a good investment based on the PE ratio 
 Examples include Enron, and a number of Japanese companies in recent years

4419,"I would probably invest up to 10% as a cushion in case of extreme cases, still, I think it depends a lot in the country you are and in the countries you are investing in"
125,Slides would be swell
5695,The bailout was propably the right thing to do although the banks should be under constant surveillance in the future
6467,"Market participants are proved to not behave rationally always, so price in P/E ratio rare reflects the true financial and ""market"" state of the company 
 Moreover, when observing bubbles of different kind, we can also see that most of multiples go crazy and never depict the true picture not only of the companies standalone, but of the sector as a whole 
 When companies report a loss, one is supposed to use other multiples that do not include earnings"

 Other assets but also amoung, other assets their should be a balance in terms of risk reward ratio 
 Since i am in the emerging markets my allocation would be around 14%- 18% since moodys rating is BBB for India 
 Thanks"
6643,"It would be better to diversify the [portfolio in a way that there is a small amount of money invested in gold, which is not too small and which provides a hedge against volatile assets that might prove unworthy in the long run.  A large proportion should be allotted to traditional assets and smaller to gold if the investor is willing to take risk, has the potential to bear short term or even long term risks and is willing to stay for a long term in the asset market 
 On the other hand, a larger portfolio investment can be diverted to owning gold in cases where the investor is risk sensitive or is willing to stay in the market for a short period of time"
4765,"I think i would not have a large part of my portfolio invested in gold,because it will entail an opportunity cost"
9152,Yes

4921,"I believe that if somebody wants to start investing in the long run, then he or she should invest a portion of the money also in gold 
 In the long run means over the course of 30, 40, 50 years or so 
 I think that it depends on the risk tolerance of every individual 
 Obviously somebody who is young, and maybe eager to increase the wealth, will risk more and may not want to buy any gold because he or she knows that there are other assets that may generate greater returns"
8289,"When comparing the effects of the policies of the 1920/30th with the policies after 2008 than I would support the unconventional monetary policy 
 Many more lives and futures were destroyed in the 1920th than in the latest crisis 
 The past cannot be changed, so let’s look forward 
 It is the task of the governments and CBs to find and implement regulations which avoid overshooting and excesses 
 But there is human nature with greed and the belief that „this time everything is different“ and we a cleverer than in the past"
4878,"It was a necessary evil although there is controversy over this move with moral hazard in perspective 
 If the US government did not bail the core financial system out it could have resulted in worser ramifications for the entire modern world 
 However, the US government did let several financial institutions fail such as Lehman and WaMu 
 For banks in the future then, they cannot be fully certain that the government will bail them out. Due to this uncertainty of which banks can get through a potential next financial crisis, risk-taking should be relatively tempered 
 As an addition, to address the actual issue of greed, forgetfulness and circumventing rules, this is something fuelled by poorly disciplined human instinct and would happen as long as there are enough parties that take part in such shady dealings and projects"
4676,"I think the assumption refers to the future earnings or profits 
 Thus, we ted to think that our company will do well in the future but it may not. And so, you are valuating a company in terms of future cash flows that may not occur 
 To the following question, yes. I think there have been times in history where the multiple-based valuation was a very unreliable method, such as the booms of the internet or the housing bubble"
928,"The assumptions include the following:   That Comparable firms are in the same industry (same operating risk) and in a similar stage of development (expected growth rates)

  To use the Sharpe ratio, we need to have a reliable measure of this volatility 
 Is this published somewhere or how is it obtained"
1312,"The bailout of US finacial sector was certainly necessary, and not only for the US economy 
 But this bailout alone can incentivize banks to be careless in their future investment activity if some rulings are not changed at the same time  (clearer distinction between investment and deposit activities, higher reserve rates, end of shadow banking, etc.)   At my point of view, some financial products and activities, like titrization, should also be avoided"
3593,"It seems to me that Federal Reserve had no other choice, otherwise the whole economy would have collapsed probably 
 But I admit that this policy gives wrong incentives to the market and banks in particular 
 The only way out of this loop, seems to be the abolition of fractional reserve banking and requiring the banks to hold 100% reserves for the checking account of people and for this service they can charge a percentage of the transactions, services that are already being provided by companies  like PayPal and others 
 The banks can accept long term deposits or can have other investments but these investments should be done on separate balance sheets to ensure that even if there is a bubble and the bank loses a lot of its assets, the checking accounts are not touched 
 This way the government need not to provide any insurance to the banks on the investments that bank do 
 In fact the most  important phenomenon that we observe during failures in the market like the 2008 crisis is not that a bubble bursts, it is the fact that regular businesses that have checking accounts with those banks can not do  business anymore 
 If we separate investment and checking accounts, we can avoid this problem"
1894,"I do not know if investing in Apple Bonds will be good for the investor 
 I do disagree that it is appropriate for Apple to borrow for the purpose of paying dividends to stock holder or to use the money to buyback shares

 I do not buy it because they are not creating  real value by taking on a new project"
7406,"From a pure\neconomical perspective the U.S 
 Government had simply no choice than the bailout 
 We all know\nwhat happened with Lehman’s Brother and how this impacted private, public,\ninstitutional investors across the globe 
 Even the tiniest German Sparkasse had\ninvestments in Lehman’ Brother – all gone 
 Nobody had a clue what the impacts/consequences could be when other global financial institutions would default or wouldn’t\nbe able to ‘assist’ the global economic system 
 Below,\nthere are two shortened sub-chapters copied from my Diploma thesis (all footnotes were\nremoved to facilitate legibility) 
  I researched the impact of global financial\nflows on the real estate sector in transforming countries 
 The thesis was\nsubmitted in January 2012 at the Technical University Berlin 
 These\nsub-chapters emphasis how the global financial system and real estate sector is interrelated and\nembedded in the global political and economic landscape 
 Simply speaking,\nthe bailout was absolutely necessary to avoid a collapse of the entire system.\nIn this context, I tend to ignore any moral or business ethical discussion on\nthis question 
 The finance\nsector  The\nformation of the global financial system is the result of national deregulation\nof capital controls, liberalization of capital flows across the globe and the\nevolvement of new technologies, telecommunication and information based\neconomy 
 Since\nthe 1980s, the global economy has been experiencing a profound shift from an\nindustrial related one to a more financially integrated one. Between 1980 and\n1995, global capital flows have fluctuated between two and six percent of world\ngross domestic product (GDP) 
  This sharply grew to 14.8 percent of world GDP by\n2006 
 Moreover,\nannual global capital flows tripled between 1995 and 2006 to a total US$7.2\ntrillion 
 The rapid transformation of the financial sector to a key driver in\nglobalization can basically be traced back to three crucial changes during the\n1960s and 1970s 
 Firstly,\nthe emergence of a Eurocurrency market in the 1960s, in which the first\ninternational financial system was developed in which banks were dealing in\nforeign currency 
 The system supported cross-border transactions and avoided\ndomestic regulations for Transnational Corporations (TNCs) due the fact they\ndeposited their surplus funds in foreign currency, thus increasing the need for\nfinancial service activity 
 This has slowly softened under the Bretton Woods\nSystem (BWS), which was established to return security to national economic\nmarkets after years of high insecurity and low worldwide trade and investment\nduring the two World Wars 
 The\nBWS collapsed in 1973 when President Nixon questioned the pegging of the dollar\nto the gold reserves 
 Secondly, declining international confidence in the US\ndollar established a system where currency exchange rates were determined by\ntheir value on the global market 
 This established a foreign currency trading\nmarket, which is the largest financial market in the world 
 Currencies can be\nsimultaneously traded in a 24-hours market completely electronically.\nTherefore, thirdly, new technological innovations became a catalyst in the\nemergence of the huge electronic financial transactions that have contributed\nto the staggering evolution of the financial industry 
 The annual turnover in\nforeign exchange was US$17.5 trillion in 1979, increasing to a daily level of\nUS$3.5 trillion or US$1,277.5 trillion annually in 2007 
 One\nadditional aspect was crucial in the globalization process and rise of the\nfinancial sector 
 When the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)\nquadrupled the price of oil, most banks were faced by a dramatic surplus of\ncapital flows 
 Moreover, nations became more dependent on banking institutions\nwhen OPEC members decided to channel the majority of their earnings ―through\nthe transnational banks 
 Within four years, between 1976 and 1980, the major\ninternational banks experienced a staggering increase of 95 percent in their\naggregated assets 
 The capital accumulation of international banks also made\nthem increasingly become lending institutions to countries, which made these\ncountries increasingly dependent on these financial institutions - a key reason\nfor growing national financial deregulation 
 Facilitated\nby global improvements in communication infrastructure and deregulation of\ndomestic financial markets, securitization of debts into marketable instruments\ncontributed to competition and vast expansion of the financial market 
 Banks\nsecuritized formerly illiquid ‘assets‘, such as a mortgage loans into ‘new‘\nfinancial products, which could be traded on the stock market 
 TNCs increased\ncapitalization by issuing equities 
 Additionally, nation states participated in\nthe financial market by issuing bonds to increase liquidity for themselves.\nAnother ‘innovative‘ financial product concerns the emergence of a secondary\nmortgage market in the United States (U.S.) 
  Formerly illiquid debts became\ntransformed into liquid and tradable mortgage-backed securities that were\ntraded on the stock exchange 
 In particular with domestic financial\nliberalization in the early 1990s, individuals and institutional investors\nsignificantly contributed to an internationalization of financial market\nactivities by the purchase of equities, shares and bonds 
 The volume of\ninternational equity issued in 1986 was at US$32 billion 
 In 1999 it rose to\nthe staggering amount of US$28 trillion 
 Real estate\ndevelopment and globalization  The\ntransformation of the urban built environment reflects the global-local\ninterplay of globalisation forces 
 [ 
 ] 
  The real estate sector is also\nan investment form, which boosts through speculation the artificial production\nof the building stock in globalising cities 
 There\nare three main developments, which have contributed to the emergence of a\nglobal real estate market 
 First,\nthe global economy‘s shift towards banking and producer service activities\ndramatically increased the demand for offices 
 [ 
 ] 
  Since the 1980s, that has led to the construction of\nmillions of sq m of new office space 
 ―The rapid building of one high-rise office\ncomplex after another has transformed cities all across the world 
 Secondly,\nthere was an internationalisation of the office market by its developers, users\nand owners 
 [ 
 ] 
  Increasing prices and growing demand for\noffice development produced record profits and attracted domestic and foreign\ninvestors 
 Panreiter emphasises that major cities, in particular those that\nhave dynamic developments in advanced producer services, also correspond high\non cross-border real estate investment 
 Part of these increasing cross-border\nreal estate transactions are based on the fact that the financial sector are\nusers and buyers of the commercial properties 
 [ 
 ] 
   Understanding\nthat real estate development is a very capital-intensive economic sector, real\nestate construction provided an ideal investment asset for the financial\nindustry 
 Real estate can act as securities and collateral for bank lending 
 In\nfact, this shows that office markets in globalising cities are linked in an\ninternational real estate and capital market 
 [ 
 ] 
   Thirdly,\nnew types of institutional investment by the end of the 1970s in form of\npension funds and insurance companies increased global real estate activities.\nConsiderable growth rates in the service sector, which promised constantly\nincreasing profits and the search for new long-term investment opportunities,\nwere major driving forces of institutional expansion 
 [ 
 ] 
  A\nkey aspect for the emergence of a global real estate market is the financial\nliberalisation [ 
 ] 
  In\nparticular, the securitisation of former fixed real estate assets into stocks\nand securities through real estate investment trusts (REITs) increased\nliquidity, transparency and capital volume for national and international\nproperty development 
 [ 
 ] 
  Predominantly\nthe securitisation of real estate from a fixed asset into a liquid and tradable\ncommodity enhanced global real estate market activities 
 A study by Jones Lang\nLaSalle in 2008 showed that the volume in direct commercial property investment\nhas more than doubled from US$354 billion in 2003 to US$759 billion in 2007.\nCross-border transactions have been also constantly growing 
 In 2003, worldwide\ncross-border commercial property transaction accounted for US$90 billion 
 That\nvolume grew to a staggering amount of US$353 billion in 2007 
 The promising\nyears of economic development between 2000 and 2007 also provided Asia-Pacific\nwith impressive economic growth rates 
 Cross-border transactions on commercial\nproperty accounted for 32 percent in 2006, and rapidly grew one year later to a\nremarkable 47 percent of all commercial property transactions in the region 
 [ 
 ] 
  Other\nfactors also increased real estate activities and their globalization 
 The\nglobal expansion of TNCs increased not just the demand for commercial real\nestate, but also the demand for residential property development, driven by a\ngrowing mobile expatriate population worldwide 
 The number of worldwide\nmigrants almost doubled from 136 million in 1990 to 210 million in 2010 
 Stimulating\nurban growth through housing and office construction has also successfully\nimpacted countries economic development by understanding how other supporting\nservices such as financing; architecture, consultancy, management and material\nproduction are involved in real estate production

 While it can be difficult to ascertain a lot of this information without knowledge of both companies,  the industry field, and a bit of additional research, the multiples-based valuation method should only be used in instances when this information is known 
 If you don't know whether a firm is truly comparable or not, you already know this will be a weak approach 
 Furthermore, the multiples-based valuation method assumes a fair value market comparison 
 However, markets do not often reflect a fair market value in the short term - stocks fluctuate and companies can be over or undervalued based on various factors 
 Short terms loses may not reflect long term gains"

 It is smart to have in the case of an extreme event, but I think having too much allocated in gold can severely hinder your returns unless something major does happen (or gold appreciates for whatever reason)

3710,"I would choose to have a fairly small portion of my portfolio to be of Gold 
 First of all, like what the lecturer said, there is an opportunity cost for investing in Gold 
 If the main purpose of me investing in Gold is too prevent extreme events that have a very small percentage of happening, investing heavily into gold seems irrational, unless you foresees an opportunity, such as raising political tension, etc. I would say in a fairly stable equity market and global economical environment, I would devote 5% of my portfolio to Gold 
 In present time, due to unsettling trends in the emerging markets, I would increase my percentage of Gold holding"

IBM was a giant back then and apple was still a young company

8002,"Hello,  I was going through the weeks video and trying to connect the dots 
 We know that if we buy a bond we love to have the lower inflation the possible to not erode the value 
 But inflation is influenced by interest rate, as bonds 
 So if central bank lower the rate, your bond already issued is gaining value, but also the inflation is going up 
 Let's say you have a zero coupon bond at 3 years with 5 % interest attached, you purchased it at 100 and the principal will pay back so 115 in three years 
 The inflation originally was at 1% 
  Now the day after the central bank lower the rates 
 The new bonds now are at 3% so with 100 you are getting 109 in three years, and your bond now has a today value of 105. The inflation has gone up to 2% due to the reduction of rate 
 You can keep your bond up to the end --> You get your 115 in three years but if nothing happens the new inflation have eroded part of your value You can sell immediately --> you get 105 while yesterday you spent 100 so you have an immediate gain of 5 that will lose in the years the value due to highly inflation unless you invest in something that benefit from higher inflation (stocks?) In any case if the raise of inflation is too much is there the possibility that new bond with lower rates into an higher inflation reality will become marginal and so the market will not be so happy to accept it 
 Just thinking out loud and probably i put in some crazyness 
 Is this view realistic"
3210,"Though I don't have any practical experience, considering the volatility in market coupled with the changing government policy in emerging market I won't feel comfortable using multiple approach

 However this method is very prone to failure 
 Usually investing in a loss making firm i.e 
 One with negative earning is not advisable; however it is to be kept in mind that if overall sector is booming there is huge probability of this as well to grow in the herd 
 Moreover insight of senior management of the company will also give us an idea of how the company is gonna perform in future"

4080,The US government's bailout of its financial sector was necessary; any bad incentives for banks resulting from the US government's action should be taken care of by regulatory measures taken by Central Banks vis-a-vis the banking sector in their respective countries
5480,"One of the functions of central banks is give stability to the currency 
 And I think the US government did a good job about TARP because it prevented financial institutions from dipping further into losses due to their troubled balance sheets caused by  troubled assets 
 I always believed in cutting your losses early so as to prevent greater losses and in this case 
 If the US have not done it we could have seen another 1930 crash"

1483,"We assume that the market price of other companies is fair and that the market is pricing the companies correctly 
 In case of a bubble, the price of one company might be well above its fair value 
 This, in turn, would further increase the price of similar companies in a positive feedback loop that leads to the bubble 
 The price of a company is a long-term value that is not fully represented by one single financial statement 
 Hence, if a company reports a loss this year, the market value calculated using the multiple methods would not be affected"

6782,"How about both 
 It seems to be generally acknowledged that the bailouts helped prevent a crisis at the scale of the Great Depression, but in spite of the Basel policies that have emerged in the wake of the crisis, too few main actors in the banking sector were persecuted for what generally seemed to be criminally irresponsible behavior 
 They can now rest assured that indeed they are too big to fail, and are therefore not incentivized to fundamentally change the behavior of excessive risk taking 
 Most of all, I am continually amazed at how Moodys and S&P managed to not only survive the crisis, but actually seem to still be the main actors in the rating industry 
 The systemic faults that helped create the crisis (the rating agencies being dependent on the goodwill of the banks who paid for the ratings) are still in place 
 Subprime loans may no longer be repackaged as AAA derivatives, but that doesn't mean a similar crisis won't appear in a related area at some point"
2277,"During the dot com bubble when stocks were overvalued and during the housing bubble when mortgages were overvalued, are two instance that a multiples valuation method would not have been appropriate -- but then again how could you know"
2535,"The assumption is that absent future greater cash flows, the  NAV and hence the stock price cannot increase We have seen in the first week that NAV is typically calculated on a 5 years basis + assuming a regular increase of cash flows beyond 
 However no one could assert that this would come true 
 These are just hypthesis, and history can show that on a five years view, analysts are mostly wrong 
 For example in 1999 they highly value Telecom stocks (Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom. 
 ) and two years later these stocks have lost more than 50% in a downturn that was a pure business recession, meaning that the diversification theory even did not work 
 Therefore, on a five years, I think that we should bet that Financial Stocks would rise, rather than stay flat 
 What is the average duration of the bad loans on the banks' balance sheets 
 When we know that figure D, I think that it would be safe to buy Financial Stocks from D - 5 
 And meanwhile a strategy would be to sell puts and / or accumulate on dips

 This inadvertently ensures growth, as people continue the consumption cycle based on credit

6747,"That assumption could be that all companies are fairly valued in the industry, that we are comparing the firm we are trying to value to other companies with the same amount of operational risk (that we are not comparing their ratios to that of all of the aggregation of all of the divisions of massive conglomerates which also operate in the area) and that they share similar cash flow growth prospects 
 Though, personally, I have not felt comfortable using the DCF method to value companies as it requires a great deal of forecasting as to the future free cash flows of a particular company and may even prove to be ineffective in the long-run as market conditions may dramatically change between now and the time in which we move out of our investments, a great deal of which we simply cannot predict 
 To quote Third Avenue Chief Investment Officer Curtis Jensen, using the DCF method to value companies is like using the Hubble space telescope 
 When it is moved a fraction of an inch, you view an entirely different galaxy, and it is the same for the DCF method for valuing companies, different assumptions which may only vary slightly have a dramatic effect in determining the fair value of the company 
 Though, using the multiples-based method of valuing companies, one does not encounter such impediments in determining an accurate value of the company and as a result, has a better sense of what the company is worth"

If for instance, the TARP program would had been addressed the house owners in order to pay back their loans, the banks balance sheets would have end up on a similar situation, with the advantage that the wealth would had been better distributed

1228,"I believe what many of the world's central banks did and the Fed in particular was necessary to not run the risk of getting into a global 1930 style depression 
 However, the point about creating an incentive for banks to be careless should not be taken lightly, and it is a very valid one. The question is, what proactive steps should the government take to ensure financial stability 
 One approach could be to do a thorough review of regulations governing banks 
 Banks play a vital role in the global economy and as such should not be allowed, by law, to take undue risks 
 There is an obvious precedent for this:  while US banks were reeling near bankruptcy in 2009, Canadian banks seemed to barely notice a financial crisis was in the making 
 None required bailouts and Canada emerged from the crisis with only a minor recession 
 Why?  In part because Canadian banking laws prohibit banks from participating in overly aggressive financial engineering (synthetic CDOs, etc) 
   Mortgage loans require proper down payments and employment verification, as they should 
 Somehow, US banks were left to figure these out for themselves,  with the result that they took on way too much risks while seemingly not caring who they lent money to 
 Too much regulation often causes red tape and inefficiencies in an economy 
 I'm not proposing to add regulations, but rather review those in place and implement the right kind of regulations so banks are required to play their proper role of providing financial liquidity and stability in a countries' economy"

4301,"I suppose that at all times, some amount of gold must be kept in the portfolio for 'security reasons', and that this amount must be increased as the economical environment gets more unstable, and decreased as the environment gets back to normal conditions 
 Quantifying this amount I think can be done considering the initial amount of money invested in other assets, times the percentage we can assume to lose due to a 'black swan': that should be the amount in gold we have to keep in our portfolio 
 When the other assets rise, this amount can be reduced accordingly, and when the other assets start to plummet, the amount of gold must be increased accordingly"

 The largest assumption is that we assume that the profits after the horizon will be constant when in reality no firm has constant profits 
 In history an example of when the multiple-based valuation method would not be best is the technology company Apple 
 In 2005 their price to earnings ratio was quite low and the price of their stock was around $50 
 The price of the stock has now been up over $130.  Any company that reported a negative earnings report would in this method of evaluation be worthless when in actuality they are not. The price to earnings multiple would be positive and when multiplied by the earnings would give you a negative number when divided by the number of shares"

 In terms of moral hazard, policy makers are the first one to blame, then comes the household

5239,"So in my analysis, and someone correct me if i'm wrong ( 
 ): 1) Market valuation means market capitalization 
 So in other words, Price * Shares 
 If you grab the price of a world stock index (E.g 
 Vanguard total market), then you can observe total market valuation with the use of a stock index 
 It all depends on the weighting, but this question, to my idea, can be seen as true 
 2 and 3) Are obviously correct 
 With booms and bust come overvalued and undervalued (or at fair value) markets 
 But a market can always become cheaper and more expensive 
 In other words, they can always move up and down 
 This can, for instance, be viewed in the light of the P/E ratio (how much earnings do i get for the stock price I pay?) 4) Seems incorrect 
 Some companies have little earnings but still have gigantic valuations (i.e 
 Unicorns such as Whatsapp) based on potential future earnings 
 They might not make a lot of money now, but they're expected to in the future, and thus have a strong price 
 As such, the market's valuation of the company is higher than book value (what it is worth now), due to the expectation of future growth 
 Also, the market may pay more for one company's earnings than it may do for another company with similar earnings"

6937,"The underlying assumption used when using any formula ratio is that the company is protected from any outside threats and/or instability in the market 
 These ratios assume that things such as yearly revenue growth remains the same, sudden market changes such as seen in 2008 and 2001 don't occur (or rather, don't effect that firm) and so forth 
 These formulas are based purely in the assumption that the firm continues on the same path without any disturbances 
 Had I had the knowledge I have today, I would not be comfortable using ratios during any era pre-2010 
 Due to the lack of technology during those days and the tendency of many firms (as expected) to use faulty numbers in their reporting standards - one might believe that a certain industry is booming and thus invest in a firm that in reality is generating zero profits (or rather, not profits that would originally satisfy the investor) 
  Give, for instance, if investors saw that Enron, having been booming during its era, was moving up in terms of market capitalization - the assumption would be that the entire industry was booming as-well 
 Using multiple based evaluation they might believe similar firms would boom as-well 
 If an investor sees that a firm has reported a negative loss - that investor should take time to identify where that loss came from and determine if it was a part of regular operations (decline in demand, decline in revenue, cost increase) or an unusual circumstance (natural disaster) by reviewing the company's financials 
 If the loss is a part of ordinary operations, the investor should determine then if he believes that the upcoming years will include a return to regular growth or if this instance of loss is foreshadowing a downfall of the firm 
 From thereon the investor should be capable of determining his new position on the firm"

 As such, investors that engage in these markets already accept the high threshold for potential profits and losses 
 Equities are offensive investments 
 Gold on the other hand is defensive 
 By disproportionately allocating a large portion of your portfolio to gold, you reduce the growth potential of your portfolio 
 An investor is better off diversifying his/her portfolio to a variety of asset classes rather than gearing up on one specific asset class in anticipation of adverse market conditions 
 Given time, the positive returns from a well balanced portfolio can buffer against abrupt adverse market conditions that may erode earnings 
 This will allow an investor to re-organize the portfolio and switch to defensive investment instruments (like gold) to weather the storm 
 As such, having some gold as part of a well diversified portfolio is prudent but having a gold intensive portfolio is ill advised"

4255,"Investing all your money in gold or in any one commodity is always risky business 
 On the other hand, gold has no intrinsic value, it doesn't pay any dividend 
 From 1986 to the present, gold increased by about 200%, while Dow Jones increased in that period of time by around 900% 
  That’s not to say you shouldn't have gold as an investment, but if you’re choosing to do so, you shouldn’t hold it as a physical investment 
 So, you should put a small percentage of your portfolio in gold for a long time frame 
 But, historically you will make more money in a 100% equity portfolio; however, if your risk tolerance doesn’t allow you to do that and you don’t want to place money in traditional bonds or other fixed income positions, gold may be a good alternative 
 So, if you still want to invest in gold it should only form a small part (around 3-10%) of your portfolio"

 On the other hand the government also gave the banks an incentive to make other risky moves that may affect the economy 
 As  we all probably know, there is a policy called the bail in, in which the government would not rescue the banks anymore, but the deponents will be the ones rescuing the banks in case of liquidation 
 I think that this bail in policy now makes the banks to be more attentive and not to rely too much on the government"

1249,"I think both arguments are valid and I personally believe this can not be treated as simple white or black 
 I think bailing out rightfully helps the banks to serve their purpose in the economy 
 Bottom line is without banks, economy will not grow 
 However,  banks' engagement in businesses that may run into high risk of having Troubled Assets (TA) needs to be controlled and regulated by regulatory organizations 
 In case of US, as far as I am aware, weak and fragmented regulations lead the banking system into trouble 
 I live in Canada and I know Canadian banks are tightly regulated based on risk evaluation, market saturation, etc.  That is to say banks simply do start any new investment in highly competitive and already saturated sectors such as retail 
 In an evidence, Canadian banking system did not experience any of the trouble US banking systems have suffered from 
 This includes 2008's economical crisis 
 To conclude, I think this is more on regulatory bodies and less on banks to ensure government will not be required to run another TARP in future"

 The US government's (and others around the world) bailout of its financial sector could be representative of such forgiveness and forbearance

 Yet, reconciliation is what we need to achieve going forward 
 In reconciliation, the financial sector, including banks and financial institutions, will need to prove their trustworthiness through words and deed, to redeem their past mistakes"
3125,"I would invest into gold not as a major investment but as an incremental insurance that will turn into assets 
 Rest of the portfolio will occupy other options that will generate income every time

1864,"There's no good response to this question 
 I agree that bailing out banks was ethically dubious and may incentivise banks to be reckless in future 
 However it's easy to criticize that decision now, after the crisis is more or less finished 
 We do not know what would have happened if US Govt wouldn't bailed out banks 
 I would argue that it was necessary, but should have been followed by the increase of oversight of financial industry (which happen only to some degree)

 And wouldn't the same thing apply to cash returns as well since inflation is among the biggest drivers of monetary policy decision-making 
 So really, gold is a hedge against inflation and the remaining graphs just represent the correlation between inflation and all those other parameters, don't they 
 It would also really help to show the correlation between gold and inflation for countries other than the US dollar and then overlay it with the currency fluctuations to show how they are all related

 This is not always the case, sometimes firms use various accounting tricks to lower their profits or share fraudulent information with investors (eg 
 Enron)

1810,"I think, that to apply multiples-based valuation methods one should choose comparable companies very carefully 
 These methods are only applicable if we can find similar companies: companies in the same field, producing similar products, having similar finanсial state, similar management process 
 It is not always easy (or even possible) to find such companies 
 Many companies try to produce goods different from other companies in the same field to gain competitive advantage 
 It may influence compatibility of companies 
 Another problem with multiples-based valuation methods exists if the whole market is under- or overvalues 
 In this case you just can't get correct estimation of fair value of stock using these methods 
 So in general I think, that it is better to use several significantly different methods of valuation, compare there results and try to understand where the differences come from"

299,"I think that when then the financial crisis began and when the world realized how important it was and how deep we were in it, Central Banks faced a dilemma: let the financial institutions sink as they were mostly responsible for what was happening or save them in order to limitate the financial damages 
 In the end, the decision was quickly made by the different central banks as the disaster involved by letting banks sink would have been of a tremendous importance 
 As banks are all correlated, damages would have come global and this would not only somehow punish the financial sector but also the private sector, households, the worldwide situation 
 Bailing out banks has been seen by central banks as a way to stem the upcoming financial crisis, its damages 
 In the end then it seems that they really had no choice 
 The decision of bailing out these establishments was not well welcomed by the populations as it meant that banks and other financial institutions were allowed to do whatever they wanted, do all the mistakes they wanted, the Governments and the Central Banks would always be there to have their back 
 We cannot say likewise for any other kind of company 
 Indeed, a bakery that does not its job well would just close definitely its doors  
  The consequences of the Central Banks’ decision are thus worth worrying about 
 What lessons did Banks really learn from their mistakes then  
  In order to avoid new financial scandals and to monitor more banks’ activity, Central Banks strengthened their expectations in terms of compulsory reserves and prudential ratios ( Bale III,  
 ) 
  This gives less flexibility to banks and aims at restoring the faith people used to have in banks"

 These are times when I would not expect the fair value to be reflected in the price and I would not feel comfortable using the P/E ratio at these times 
 But, in general, I wonder whether the mutiple-based valuations are better than the DCF method 
 There seem to be many factors that are subjective; for example how do we evaluate the effectiveness of management and whether different managers are comparable 
 I think it would have been instructive to have examples of calculations made using both DCF and multiple-based valuations; to gain some feeling as to the error range of each and how the error ranges compare"

 This assumption is crucial when we make a peer set.  When the price is of a company is not being traded at the Stock Exchange on rational basis, or rather on pure sentiment, the PE multiple derived may not represent the true picture and thus this may result in an overestimated valuation 
 One needs to see the logical reasons to understand that if a company is being traded at a higher/Lower  multiple than in other times what is making the price soar/ down

 A valuation multiple is simply an expression of market value of an asset relative to a key statistic that is assumed to relate to that value 
 You would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies when that statistic – whether earnings, cash flow or some other measure – does not bear a logical relationship to the market value observed, when it is not seen as the driver of that market value 
 A multiple is a distillation of a great deal of information into a single number or series of numbers 
 By combining many value drivers into a point estimate, multiples may make it difficult to disaggregate the effect of different drivers, such as growth, on value 
 The danger is that this encourages simplistic – and possibly erroneous – interpretation 
 A multiple represents a snapshot of where a firm is at a point in time, but fails to capture the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of business and competition 
 Multiples are primarily used to make comparisons of relative value 
 But comparing multiples is an exacting art form, because there are so many reasons that multiples can differ, not all of which relate to true differences in value 
 For example, different accounting policies can result in diverging multiples for otherwise identical operating businesses 
 The use of multiples only reveals patterns in relative values, not absolute values such as those obtained from discounted cash flow valuations 
 If the peer group as a whole is incorrectly valued (such as may happen during a stock market ""bubble"") then the resulting multiples will also be misvalued 
 Multiples are based on historic data or near-term forecasts 
 Valuations based on multiples will therefore fail to capture differences in projected performance over the longer term, and will have difficulty correctly valuing cyclical industries unless somewhat subjective normalization adjustments are made 
 Companies with losses (negative earnings) or no profit have an undefined P/E ratio (usually shown as ""not applicable"" or ""N/A""); sometimes, however, a negative P/E ratio may be shown 
 There are multiple versions of the P/E ratio, depending on whether earnings are projected or realized, and the type of earnings

 However, the other two answers are correct because ""expensive"" & ""cheaper"" index can always become both more so depending if the earnings of the companies within this index move in a greater proportion (percentage) than the price move of the index 
 Question 8 The correct answers are: A) Over this time\nperiod, there was a greater chance of observing extremely bad monthly returns\n(more negative than -20%) than extremely good monthly returns (more positive\nthan 20%) 
  B) Over this time period, there was a 80% chance of observing a monthly\nreturn between -10% and 10% 
  Rationale: A) is correct because if we look at the histogram there are no observations on the right side, where the returns have been more than +20%

 However, as in the recent case of Burger Kind, they decided to do a reverse-merger with a Canadian company which resulted in tax and other savings as well as access to other markets, something that a multiple would not reflect at that time 
 On the flip side McDonalds was performing particularly poorly in the previous few years (the last year was a turnaround) and if we used a multiple we would overvalue its stock when the intrinsic (company specific) factors would prove otherwise 
 In order to properly value the company a DCF model is necessary, though it may not tell the whole story for which we would need to ""anchor"" its value with alternative valuation techniques such as multiples"
7671,"Dear Mentor,  Please I have problem with the quiz I need help my answers are right but the system is saying something else 
 Please do I need to put the answer for instance 2 or ""2"" 
  Please I have tried twice and the still not getting it due to these error 
 Looking forward to your response"
3688,"Assets that generate similar cash flows must have the same price 
 For a company that reported a loss, there could be a lot of factors that drive cash flow like cost of raw materials, consumer and market trends, quality of management making decisions, etc"
1003,"We assume that the multiples of company we are assessing are behaving similarly to peers 
 The instance where i would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies is where there are no peers for this company 
 Also multiples are not considered for overtime valuation and do not take forecast into account"
1766,"When we use ratios to make investment\ndecisions our assumption is that the companies are identical or at least within\nthe same industry and have similar characteristics such as earnings, growth, and\nreturns"
8986,Yes
6085,"Little to no part of my portfolio 
 Perhaps <5% 
   Gold isn't productive and doesn't grow or provide dividends, but can be seen as a hedge against inflation/extreme economic events"
2034,"Capital structure of the firms has to be similar for multiple-based valuation methods to be used 
 During the  _domain_  boom multiple based valuation methods probably did not work as the P/E ratios ascribed by the market of comparable firms did not represent future earnings"
735,"There should be a balance of bailout and holding the bad actors accountable for their actions 
 The bailout is good for the overall society so the mass do not suffer from the actions of a few. The bad actors in the financial world needed to be cleaned out so they don't have a chance to repeat their behaviors as well as serving a warning across the bow for the financial institutions that they are accountable to everyone and weight their decisions to avoid short cuts or self enriching practices"
2784,In depends on the investment goals and expected future returns but probably would rebalance once every year or so
7747,"Lorric I think you are right 
 Discount rate = (final asset value - initial asset value) / initial asset value Then we should have : (100- 90)/90 = 11.1% If I think in $100 in one year and a discount rate of 10%, then the NVP= $90,91"
8422,I would invest a relatively small part
2899,I will hold moderate ratio of gold as it will leverage both side of risk
129,"I think the US government made the right decision by removing illiquid through assets purchase 
 This decision revived the economy and there was no way the government could have assigned the banks to do so 
 It'd have taken much longer"
3456,"There are advantages and disadvantages as well, but the effects will be realized in the long run. Banks should be held accountable as individuals are being held accountable by their decisions 
 As long as the banks are being bailed out, the tendency to be careless and more adventurous will continue, regulations should be put to clearly define the lines 
 The action of the US government during that time was good only for well, that time"
3095,"Hi, could someone help and explain what is included into technical factors influencing the stock market 
 The topic is covered in the video ""How to follow the stock market"" but I can't get what's in there."
9066,"Yes 
 But I believe it is some necessary bad incentive to prevent the economy from going too bad. As we learned in this session, the capability of the Central Bank to boost the economy is limited compared to its utility in cooling down overheating economy"
3355,"I think that the US goverment's  bailout of its financial sector was necessary 
 This said,the fact that it can be interpreted as a precedent is alarming,"
819,"Well since investing is gold is considered as am insurance rather than an investment, then you should strategically allocating to this commodity few percentages of your portfolio in normal market conditions 
 However, when market conditions change either due to monetary policy or political unstability or liquidity crisis or non performing loans then the need to increase your portfolio allocation towards gold becomes a necessity 
 Since when this happens, this shifts your investment perspective in gold from hedging against black swans into investing opportunity that is to be realized when detecting market signals 
 So in a nutshell, strategically allocation in gold should be as hedging factor while tactical shifts in the allocation are plausible depending on market conditions"
1106,"I believe the FED has done right after the 2007 crisis (compared to the Eurozone) 
  This policy has heated the American economy 
 Now, the FED wants to raise interest rates but the recent economic index are not supporting this decision 
 In February, the Unemployment Rate remained the same  but the non-farm payrolls increased 
 This increase was mainly in healthcare, retail, and food services (the last 2 pay less), so the numbers are not so ""good"" 
  People are unwilling to invest and/or spend money 
 So, I believe the FED instead on focus only in numbers should seek the reasons why the economy has showing these numbers (understand people's behavior that I believe it is one of the main factors that drives the economy) 
  This is corroborated by the situation in Japan where low interest rates hasn't resulted in higher economic growth"
4725,"I would invest in a relatively small amount of gold to make up my portfolio 
 Extreme events are bound to happen, regardless of how predictable they are. Therefor I would have just enough gold to possibly forecast a reasonable amount insurance of said extreme event 
 Hopefully the rest of my portfolio would be well invested in stable companies, but just in case I would have enough gold to hedge the likelihood of a crisis 
 Considering that investments are assets that are supposed to enhance my standard of living, I would take the risk 
 Because most likely, before or if a crisis occurs, I will still be reaping the benefits from the assets in my portfolio 
 Once again, however, I would calculate the worth of all my assets and then assign a value to that worth in terms of insurance--which would become the amount of gold I would invest"
6784,"Hi, I am an IT Director from Canada and I am looking forward to the course and hopefully some interesting discussion 
 I am taking this course to further my knowledge in the area of investment management and because I always enjoy learning more 
 \n Chris"
5575,"From my point of view, this behaviour is bad in the long run, because it tends to relax credit-risk analysis"
3549,"I think what happened in 2008 was an economic crisis outside the normal boom and bust cycle, caused by the speculative behavior of the banks 
 The situation was so bad that the government did not have any alternative that buy back that debt 
 At that point, In my opinion, there were no other options 
 The bailout was an exceptional and necessary measure 
 Of course it had consequences for the banking system 
 For that, it was mandatory for governments to provide changes in bank regulations and credit ratings  in order to prevent the situation to be repeated again and allow the markets to recover and regain trusts 
 I am not knowledgeable on what was put in place at the end and if there was any follow up of these new regulations"
5343,"Since majority of the people invest in the markets for retirement, I would say the ratio depends on how much time you have for retirement 
 Eg (Assuming 30-40 years of employment earnings) : A fresh graduate has time to absorb a catastrophic event, whereas someone who has say about 10 years to retirement may not be able to stomach a catastrophic event"
3269,"One of the main assumptions on using, for example, P/E ratios on valuation is that you are comparing different companies and using the same ""performance"" ratio 
 Although is probable that you find similar companies, it is impossible that 2 companies are exact same 
 They have different managers, strategies, operational challenges, so twhat you really are doing is putting 2 companies and assuming they are exact same 
 I rarely use P/E ratio to compare companies, although can be an indicator for a segment of market, i.e 
 Companies that work on oil business, often has a P/E ratio of XX.X 
 To get a closer and fair P/E ratio you need to get a mean of more time than just a semester 
 If a company constantly reports losses, then you should avoid being a shareholder of this particular company"
1362,"On one hand side the TARP prevented a global catastrophe as e.g 
 Even firms like GE could not access short-term liquidity to maintain its operations, and gained money for the taxpayers (the government acted like a giant distressed hedge fund) 
  On the other hand this intervention created the too big to fail incentive for financial institutions 
 However, to argue only basing on the TARP in order to debate bad incentives to Banks seems too short-sighted to me 
 Conventional and unconventional monetary policies should be part of the debate, as well as regulations etc. Furthermore the question does not encompass client behavior towards Banks that received government help"
7147,"Hi, Mohamed Khamis Ibrahim Assran Eltouni, thanks for your question 
 The allocation of portfolio mentioned in the course is not a certain rule, in my opinion 
 The allocation depends on how much risk you can afford, how long you will invest, etc. Enjoy the course 
 Racheal"
2373,"This could be true that it is a bad incentive for banks 
 Conversely, the housing bubble has been such a negative growth incentive for the banks on the whole, that possibly, it was needed in such a crisis time 
 Hopefully, the banks and other institutions will not see it as a repeated occurrence in the future"
925,"I believe that the bail out by the US government and others around the world was necessary as later events have shown 
 Ghana had a similar government intervention in the 1980s 
 As part of the Economic Recovery during this period, a Non Performing Assets Recovery Trust was set up to acquire, hold and dispose off non-performing assets in order to clean up the balance sheet of government thereby expanding the fiscal space for government to borrow of economic development 
 The results were not as expected though since private capital did not take up these assets for turnaround as intended"
8669,A relatively small part (less than 10%) as part of cash fund
1986,"Unfortunately, bailout was a necessary step for CB and failing to do so would have created a so-called domino effect for the whole economy and the outcomes would be much more severe 
 However, to avoid the repetitiveness of the previous error and careless behavior, CB could impose additional requirements in commercial lending market"
8161,"Long term  Equities appear to offer better returns , so you should be 100% vested in Equities, however my own risk tolerance would be concerned with short term volatility for the more extreme market moves (greater than 10%)  
  As protection I would look to have Gold as an insurance on my overall assets, representing  say 10 - 12.5% of overall Portfolio"
6770,Necessary but consider the changes in regulation to manage future bank activities
1931,"I would rather to keep small part of gold in the portfolio 
 Black swan does not happen often, it is real rare"
1098,I believe I would evaluate the opportunity cost and try to find a balance between that and the risk
1297,10-15% of gold

8521,Small % of gold
8583,"I would usually go for a relatively small part of the portfolio in gold, say 10-15%"
713,"In my opinion, the US govt 
 Did a required job to let the economy role and revive while getting a good lesson of collective madness and manipulation 
 Though it was questionable for many reasons, it prevented many more institutions and households from default 
 Investors' deposits were saved, business borrowers could fund and roll their businesses 
 The fat cats were saved for the sake of saving the people who were victims of the vicious scheme"
5800,"Diversificationis key. By holding a large position in gold you miss oppurtunities 
 A small allocation can be considered if it fits client profile"
1203,"Well, I recommend another course, which in my opinion,explain this quite well 
 The global financial crisis,from Yale"
3267,"We assume that companies which we compare are in the same conditions (market, economy etc. etc.) 
   There are many instances in history where people would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies 
 If this way was perfect, why people needed to find other ways 
 A company can report a loss but if they have current/long term assets, these will create value for them 
 If that value can compensate their current/long term liabilities we can still say that company may create value for its current and future shareholders"
5589,Is undervaluation/overvaluation intentional or is it a consequence of prevailing market conditions
861,I would want to put no more than 30% of my portfolio in gold
633,"I think Government role is to create an enabling environment to promote economic growth 
 In this regard, when an economy suffers from a crisis, the government must use tools (conventional or unconventional) that it has to deal with this crisis 
 In other words government is a regulator and as such it plays a regalian role in the economy environement according to John Meynar KEYNES 
 Therefore, the US government's (and others around the world) bailout of its financial sector was simply necessary for the well-being of the economy as a whole 
 Meanwhile, some measures should be taken to deter the reappearance of the crisis causes"
2065,"Bailing out is a last resort and it is required to revive a economy 
 However it is not necessary to been seen as an incentive to the banks as its used only as a rescue mechanism"

4906,"I think the assumption we make is that the market is providing a fair value for a comparable company 
 However, this may not always be the case 
 The equity risk premium may be much higher at the top of a bull market providing a high p-e ratio or too low at the bottom of a bear market providing a very low p-e ratio."
6019,"Hi Veronica, It is a pleasure in meeting you here, I am from New York"
1506,"I would rather have a small share of my potfolio invested in gold, which would be driven by the level of diversification, possibility of short selling and the probability and materiality of possible crash on markets"
31,"When using the ratios we assume that the earnings and other date is accurate and the market is stable and fair 
 In situations like those of the financial crisis or situations that appear to be bubbles, you may not be comfortable using market ratios 
 In the instance that companies report losses that may also skew the market ratios"
7932,"I didnt seem to be getting the answer to this week quiz correctly, can anyone be of help 
 I hadly score 40% in it"
1666,"P/E ratios reflect market enthusiasm 
 They can be way off actual values"
3776,"As you may have realized in the preceding quiz, finding the exact fair value of a stock using the DCF valuation method is not always an easy task 
 In fact, Themis Themistocleus, one of our guest speakers from UBS, put it in the following words:  ""But you have to understand discounted cash flow makes a lot of assumptions over many years 
 People find it very cumbersome and it's also prone to mistakes 
 So they tend to take shortcuts, they tend to take simpler valuation methodologies like price to earnings, cash flow yield, dividend yield, to get an answer to what the fair value is.""   There is however a very important assumption we make when we use ratios we observe on the market (like price-to-earnings) to value other comparable companies 
 What could that assumption be 
 Were there instances in history where you would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies 
 What about companies that just reported a loss (i.e 
 Negative earnings)"
2203,I think it was necessary
1478,"The most important assumption is that the stocks whose P/E ratios (or other price ratios) we use are fairly priced 
 (Another important assumption is that earnings or other financial accounting numbers in the denominator have been correctly estimated.) The  _domain_  bubble in the late 1990s is a good recent example where multiple-based valuation methods would have been a questionable tool when evaluating tech stocks in particular and probably other U.S 
 Stocks as well 
 If earnings are negative, then the P/E ratio is meaningless; otherwise we would interpret the negative ratio as implying a negative value 
 But the lowest that share value can be is zero"
1441,"I believe these bailout were necessary to avoid the potential recession and the bank crisis, especially it is not frequently happening situation, and I do not think banks will misuse this incentive as they do not guarantee that central banks will purchase any other assets in the future"
3068,"The assumption that all companies perform similar inside the same industry 
 There are other factors that contribute to the value of a firm such as the good or bad decisions they take in terms of marketing, innovation, investment in new proyects and so forth"
955,"Assumptions could be to compare with the companies having same financials and similar market values 
 The approach to multiple based valuation fails in circumstances where price is over inflated or under valued against earnings in comparison to other companies in the same sector"
2961,"The main advantage of using gold is a safetenes of nasty unexpected events that may happen

266,"The banks knew that the government would bail them out before the crisis, they didn't need to be incentivized then and they don't need to be incentivized now. What's needed is politicians with the courage to enact and enforce bank regulation"

4692,"If the portfolio is consisted in a very different type of assets, following the rule of diversification, I'd say it would be safest to have 1/10 to 2/10 of the portfolio invested in gold, depending on the country were are based"
9146,Yes
6663,I would rather have a fairly small percentage of gold (10-20%)
3351,"Bailout was indeed necessary to stop the economy dipping into depression 
 Undoubtedly in so doing there was a signal to banks that they can continue to be careless and the government will always be there to bail them out. However if the bailout is done in conjunction with bank related reforms in regulations (and this was the approach adopted), the governments are effectively removing the incentive to the banks to again be reckless"
7444,I'd rather have around 10% to 12% invested in gold serving as source of insurance performance
918,"I think that the bailout was necessary for the economy but the government should have punished the people that were involved in the subprime crisis, because now the banks knows tha if thinks go wrong agail the government will help them and that is bad for the economy"
7623,"As a conservative investor, I would always have a minimum of 15% of my portfolio weight in Gold, adjusting between 15-25% depending on overall market situation 
 I may miss out on other investment opportunities when I am holding 15% in Gold, but I can be assured that at least 15% of my investment will (historically) be safe"
487,"Hello everyone, it's nice to learn how actually the stock market works"
8208,"So I typed it all out but i'm not sure i'm supposed to give it all away 
 Some tips:   Use a wacc of 11% 
  Don't discount with 1.1, but with 1.11 
 Make sure to discount the terminal value as well 
 Meaning you do (1.04/0.07)*(407) 
  And then you discount it as well for the third period 
 Note that enterprise value is all discounted cashflows for period 1 through 3, as well as the terminal value discounted for period 3"
280,"In so called ""low interest rate policy"" of CB (government), there is no direct impact on banks behavior

2080,"I believe that this bailout was necessary, but it should come with much tougher caveats as to how to conduct business in the future 
 Much like how a parent disciplines their child who erred by imposing guidelines as to how, under certain circumstances, he should behave in the future"
6083,"I think this is arguable,

 \nNPV=9.91""  Philip's video on this does not dive deep into the set-up of NPV. I set it up in excel using the CFO as CF1. I was wrong and obviously got the wrong result-as others have explained in this thread 
 Also, in a alter assignment, NPV is used as an absolute- 𝑁𝑃𝑉=𝑃𝑉(𝐵𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑓𝑖𝑡𝑠)−𝑃𝑉(𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑠) for a one share price valuation 
 I misunderstood the question and used NPV to valuate the CFs of the firm throughout t 
 I may be a minority on this 
 For me the question was not clear and I used the content (NPV in this case) in a different manner 
 Hope this helps"
7902,"Are you able to figure out the formulas 
 As mentioned I haven't done this in 20 years and am really struggling, they simply don't explain it in the videos"
5862,"In my opinion, it was definitely necessary to save the biggest banks as it happened with Credit Suisse and UBS in Switzerland 
 We saw the huge consequences of the Lehman collapse and if the government would not have bailed out other big institutions, the whole financial system could have broken down 
 Nevertheless, we have to  come up with regulations (as Basel II & III) for financial institutions to improve the stability of the whole system and make sure this will not happen again"

1311,"There are several instances were you can't use multiples, negative earnings is an instance since the p/e ratio would be negative and the comparison basis would not be viable anymore 
 Another instance would be is that there is inflation in the price of the asset so that the sector we are looking at is experiencing a bubble or an elevated valuations 
 In such cases, we would know that the target company is over/under-valued when compared to its peers but we won't know if the price paid for the company is fair or above fair value as execussive demand could drive prices to substantial levels that are above the fair value one"
8127,"Multiples-based earnings methods have a few drawbacks: 1) The P/E ratio will often be subject to accounting judgements that may distort the earnings 
 For example if a company has posted a significant reduction in profits due to the requirement to recognise a large provision, that will alter the earnings for the year and impact the P/E ratio but in actual fact the business hasn't fundamentally changed and may otherwise actually have been more profitable 
 2) They assume that the company will continue to generate value for its shareholders at the rate it has been; it doesn't take forward looking data into account very well 
 3) It assumes that the companies are similar enough in nature that the ratios are relevant 
 4) If you report a loss then you get a negative value of the company 
 This isn't necessarily true"
8204,No more than 10%
4003,"For a company that just reported a loss, the P/E method breaks down 
 Key assumptions in using comparable could be that the companies apply similar accounting policies, leading to a situation where they have similar cashflows, the companies are at the same stage in their life cycle, meaning that they have the same growth prospects etc. The killer assumption in the latter stage is that the companies will continue to exhibit similar cashflows and growth trajectory going forward 
 This may however not be the case 
 Asset specific risks such as industrial strikes, problems with key suppliers, quirked in quality control, poor stewardship on the part of managers etc may set one company apart from the other 
 In Ghana for example a pharmaceutical company that was hit by a counterfeiting scandal would have thrown valuation out of gear if were used as a comparable for valuing another company simply because it had similar cashflows to the target company"
5224,I am worried about TARP but the bailout was necessary for a faster recovery
1567,"As he said, if you can get 5% just from putting your money in the bank, why risk it in Fair Value Equities 
 What is important is to learn the Fair Value of a Company in the short term and the short term dynamics that will affect the fair market value of the company 
 Only then consider the risk if you are going to invest in the long term 
 Investing in a firm that shows negative earnings is TOO risky 
 The simple formula  to forecast is to look at Sales the Costs and from these determine the Profits in order to establish future cash flow evaluations"

 We assume optimistically that the company will have a certain earning regardless of the situation 
 But the company can have low earnings in the future because of many factors such as climate change, political change and regulation changes etc. As a result, the assumption can be very wide of the mark and result can not be relied upon 
 Now if a company just reported a loss the price to earning ratio will be negative and based on that our assumptions will also suffer 
 But the company have have loss because of his cost due to research and because of the R&D cost it will generate huge earning in the future 
 So if we take multiple valuation method our assumptions will be wrong not to invest in the company"

 The borrower needs to pay the lender more money because it is riskier 
 You also have to consider the situation of the lender in general too. Too much debt is risky, and debt on top of debt is even riskier, because there is a greater chance the debts will not be repaid (default) 
  Depending on how the Index is weighted, if higher interest rate Greek bonds become a bigger part of the Index, then it will shift the entire Index 
 Since the Index is a composite of multiple EU bonds, it's like adding a higher number to a group of numbers that would shift the average for all of them higher"

6222,This is a good explanation
4679,"It was a bad incentive because: actions were not taken by the Federal reserve and the SEC  to properly stem the careless practices that led to the crises in the first place before bailing out the banks 
 Some of the practices include but is not limited to:  1)placing highly leveraged bets against the asset backed securities (mortgage backed Securities) they issued to uniformed investors just to make quick profit,  2) lack of control of the interest rates ( floating rates) on the mortgages given to individuals that barely had the resources to pay back the loans, so when the rates increased they defaulted on their repayments on their mortgages  the asset backed securities became worthless,  3) the bankers kept on marketing the already worthless securities to unsuspecting investors on the secondary market coupled with the fact that the rating agencies did not downgrade the ratings of those securities 
 Therefore the Federal Reserve used tax payers money to bail out banks that intentionally carried out careless practices that can be repeated in the future 
 The Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies should instead have increased regulation and monitoring of the banks before bailing them out to prevent a repeat of such carelessness on the part of the banks then bail them out to boost the economy"

 Every sector played their part including government and households and individual investors 
 So blaming banks for everything is wrong and misguided 
 The bailout was necessary and the consequences of a non bailout would have been disastrous for all parties involved 
 If the government hadnt bailed out the banks it would have spread to every financial institution around the world and theyre lending effects households and businesses in every sector 
 Housing, small businesses, large businesses all would have seen their loans called or funding dry up, causing loss of jobs, deposits and business failures 
 The bailout could create bad incentives but the next crises might not involve every bank and no one wants to be the next Lehman Brothers or Bear Sterns so companies have a lot of incentive to manage their risk"
3246,"No, i won't have high level of portfolio allocation to gold just because it has the potential to be the ultimate currency 
 Just recall what we have already learnt in the videos, the occurrence of extreme events is very unlikely and is actually a black swan, so there will be a huge opportunity cost behind it if we are invested too heavily in Gold and also since it is a commodity, it is also bound to face huge variance in its value 
 For hedging purpose the max portfolio  allocation to gold should be at max 5% 
  Some extreme events like political tension, economic consequences (economic failures), hyper inflation etc are hot the kind of events that could occur overnight 
 Such types of cracks or fissures develop over time and thus could be gauged/traced and patterned out.  The best way to portfolio management is diversification where we are giving a justified exposure to each of the asset classes whether it is emerging bonds/equities, developed country bond/equity 
 The exact allocation quantity can easily vary depending of people preferences and also as per the changes the global economic and political environment but the above type of portfolio dynamics can actually help a person to create wealth for himself and in turn take advantage of wealth creation happening all around the world"

  Of course for geopolitical Risk or Risk on the stability of the monetary system gold is vers useful in a portfolio 
 A rule of thumb for the weight of gold in ouf portfolio would be: look at real yield (cost of opp), your expectation about inflation and monetary stability and what the market is currently telling (headline in the news, inflation expectation, inflation break-even in the ,tips market) 
  Create an easy formula that allocate between 0%  and 5% based on these 3 inputs

6160,"An important assumption that comes to mind is equilibrium 
 I think it is important that the security in question is in an approximately equilibrium state in terms of growth, profitability, and company management 
 For example, a company with a new pharmaceutical that has yet to enter the market may be incurring a loss despite a positive outlook on future earnings 
 In this case, the company is not in an equilibrium state since it may undergo rapid changes 
 Conversely, a company with historical high earnings may have just experienced a supply-side shock that will likely lower its long-term profitability 
 In such a case, it is not in an equilibrium state and using the multiplier may lead to misleading valuations 
 In addition to internal equilibrium, macroeconomic equilibrium is also an important consideration 
 For example, a change in the macroeconomic climate could severely affect a firm's profitability and can therefore change the firm's value from a multiplier perspective 
 Summarily, it is important to use financial tools in a way that not only preserves the model's integrity, but also in a way that appropriately accounts for possible changes to future earning potential 
 It is therefore critical to consider equilibrium during security valuation"

 That means you ended up with 1 = 100% of what you started with, but nothing more 
 95/95 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0, means you earned 0% 
  If you start with 100 and end up with 90, 90/100 = 90% (we certainly didn't make 90%, did we?)

 In addition, if two companies are competitors (They are previously assumed to be in the same industry, development stage and so on ), they will always find a way to differeciate  themselves from the other 
 For example, Alipay and WeChat Pay are the two biggest payment companies in China, both supported by a larger Group behind and both offering the same service to consumers

 It is important to understand the inherent risks of certain assets, weigh your own adversity to risk, your desired financial objectives, and then balance in a pragmatic way that hedges risk at what one deems to be a reasonable price and that is congruent with said factors"

 That would be a very minuscule ROI. During that time, my gold paid no interest or dividends and I would have had to store it and protect for 2000 years 
 Why would I expect gold to perform any better over my investing lifetime 
 In the US, a small investor is going to pay high transaction costs to buy and sell physical gold

 So how can valuation be right 
 One can argue when the transaction has occurred, but as bubbles might show is that information is not that efficient 
 Another aspect is the aggreation of value and price versus the individual investor who likes to push his/her value and price expectations 
 So the term efficiency might obscure complexity of reality more than that it is helpful 
 Lastly can a market be really efficient if manipulation occurs or the fact that some believe in market engineering or active policy 
 In very simple wording: when the seller and buyer have different opinions with or without a squeeze (that complicates efficiency)"

2330,"Depending on the investor's risk appetite, gold can be used an alternative for cash(or part of the iron reserve) because of the multiple reasons: 1 
 We have seen that the average rate of return on gold is around 8% over the last 45 years 
 2 
 The liquidity of gold is high and it can easily be converted into cash whenever required 
 If the investor is diversified their portfolio by investing in equities as well, then the following will happen: 1 
 When the market is going up and inversely, the price of gold is falling: a 
 If the investor reorganizes their portfolio to balance their asset diversity, they should sell the equities( for a profit) and buy more gold(which will be at a low price) 
  b 
 If there is a need for the iron reserve to be utilized(i.e 
 In case of emergencies), then equities are liquid enough to be converted into cash

 In the case when the market is going down, the price of gold will increase and the same points highlighted will be taken in inverse"

632,"The biggest issue with using multiples is finding the similar company 
 Companies may work in the same sector and partly do the same business but they are not comparable because they have different business models, divisions, work in different regions etc. For instance, try to use multiples to for Apple and HP or Microsoft and IBM or Google and Facebook 
 As companies try to differ from their competitors to become successful, it seems more unlikely to find a perfect match 
 Another problem with multiples is that we assume that the benchmark company is priced fairly 
 However, it can hardly be that way. Though, we can use regression to get a sort of ""average"" price, I don't believe that it isn't always possible to find several similar companies listed on a stock exchange to conduct such analysis"

6353,"Good question 
 I think that the bail-out of the banking sector was necessary but I have concerns over how it was executed 
 I was living in the UK at the height of the financial crisis and there was a real risk that, if the government has not stepped in, we would have seen more bank runs and the collapse of the banking system 
 My main concern is that the bail-out created bad incentives for bankers 
 Many bankers received extremely high remuneration despite being very poor stewards of their banks 
 In the UK, I am concerned that the bail-outs resulted in a concentration of the banking sector and so we faced with the risks that we have banks that are ""too big to fail"" and a decrease in competition 
 Having been bailed out by the state, I feel that many banks now put more effort into lobbying government rather than putting effort serving society by providing a return to savers and providing credit to the real economy"

5082,"Considering gold as a hedge, my asset allocation would depend on a lot of factors:    Political Stability domestically and world wide;   My profile as an investor correlated with my age and my amount of wealth;   World economy indicators 
 Currently, in 2018, at the age of 31, I would probably allocate 30% of my assets in gold considering I'm living in Brazil, which is now passing through a change in political ideologies (left to right) after living through a huge crises for the past few years 
 However, if I was 60, my asset allocation in gold would be 70% due to my age and time in history - considering I'm not a conservative nor aggressive investor 
 The world at the moment is also presenting many ""moving parts"" with Trump playing the big boy in the playground looking for a fight with major economies like China and other economies like Italy going through tough tough times and destabilizing the Euro zone

 So in the case of the financial crisis of 2008 TARP with its ultimate use to inject capital into banks was the absolute right thing to do in my view 
 The fact that it actually made money for the taxpayer while helping to avoid a second Great Depression is evidence of that"

 Annual reports and the Financial Times are old news that others have already acted upon 
 There isn't a lone number in an annual report or column in the FT or WSJ  that can tell you if a stock is over-valued or under-valued 
 You also need a lot of capital to be able to spread your risks among many different securities 
 The instructor uses somewhat extreme examples in which a stock goes from $100 to $50 
 That won't happen often 
 There are many things taught in this course that a small investor won't have the resources, time, or ability to act on

 This might bring some more stability - or at least they cannot take as much risk as before 
 However im not sure if things changed fundamentally - there have been some cases where bankers after a bailout surprised themselfs with very high bonuses- This would suggest everything goes as before 
 Also there is this argument in some cases that ""its too big to fail"" - like for now at Deutsche Bank

 The distribution of wealth is very unequal and unfair and the death of the middle class impose some change in terms of government priorities

 The economies of scale in banks and in other businesses are worth preserving, so long as they are well regulated in proportion to their economic clout 
 \n However, to avoid one of the problems this creates -moral hazard- I believe that such large organisations should be deliberately broken up 
 According to Alan Greenspan, ""If they're too big to fail, they're too big"" 
  Failure is an integral part of any market system 
 So, although the financial institutions that were bailed out were indeed important to the financial system, the fact that they took risk beyond what they would otherwise, should be enough for the Government to let them face the consequences of their actions 
 It would have been a lesson to motivate institutions to proceed differently next time

 Multiple based valuation methods are no easily used on companies making a loss 
 If it was a one-off loss in the current year, and we forecast future positive earnings & cash flows, the method could still be used (assuming we believe the loss to be one off!)

 In periods of market exuberance or gloom, the multiples are skewed and does not necessarily reflects the fundamentals of the company we are trying to value 
 In short, while DCF uses a lot of assumptions, it is based more on the fundamentals of a company whereas multiples valuation is more market based 
 For example, during a market turmoil like the subprime crisis in 2007/8, the entire stock market was badly hit and the valuations on stocks then would not have fully reflected the fundamentals of the company 
 A company that reported a loss may sway market participants to assign it a lower multiple that can be discounted to its fundamentals

 The government has the responsiblity to create this framework within its country and make sure all actors comply with it 
 The subprime crisis showed that the government did not provide a framework which protected consumers and other companies from reckless actors on the market 
 The Troubled Asset Relief Program was therefore an important measure to prevent the Americans from the worst 
 But the actual task of the government was then to develop a framework which would not allow again for such a crisis

3261,"This question could be better phrased as, ""Do governments give bad incentives to bankers?"" Put this way, the answer clearly is yes, because we know that people most definitely respond to incentives 
 A banker who knows that his or her bad decisions could lead to the bank's failure will recognize he or she has some skin in the game, whether it be a pension plan, executive stock options, continued employment, or professional reputation 
 Remove enough of this risk of failure thus increases the odds of greater risk-taking by the bankers (hence the banks) in the future 
 Moreover, programs such as TARP penalized good actors in two ways 
 First, it kept afloat competitors whose employees had made bad decisions and thus hindered the natural ability of markets to reward those who make good decisions and punish those who make bad decisions 
 Bankruptcy is analogous to allowing natural forest fires to periodically clear out the underbrush: if you suppress all forest first, the deadwood and underbrush accumulates and, when a fire inevitably breaks out, it is far more catastrophic 
 Second, TARP deliberately forced many sound financial institutions to participate, thus given political cover for helping out failing institutions 
 This action helped fuel the popular misconception that all financial institutions were a bunch of greedy bastards who had upended the economy 
 But fueling populist resentment often leads to bad public policy, such as the illusion that the Dodd-Frank Act actually resolved the ""too big to fail"" policy when in fact it made it worse in the U.S"

 The DCF method, for example, allows the intrinsic value of an equity to be justified, it relies FCF rather than accounting figure 
 On the flip side, DCF is based on assumptions on inputs (growth rate, required return on equity, etc) and it is often difficult to forecast cash flows in cyclical businesses 
 The multiples-based valuation methods are easy to apply and understand and there are fewer assumptions made as with DCF. However, the choice of multiples used can be subjective (or multiples maybe mis-priced by the market) 
  Occasionally, it can be difficult to find the right peer group or relevant comps"

 I am in my 20s so am more concerned with increasing my income rather than ensuring standard income as I might want to focus on in retirement"
4962,"Personally, I have mixed feelings about this 
 However, I must stress the fact that I do agree when people and corporations are taking unnecessary risk to generate and accumulate wealth for themselves, they should pay the consequences (High Reward = High Risk) 
  If the government is to provide ""bail-out"" solutions (using the public money), what is the incentive for these people to stop taking the unnecessary risk 
 The problem here is the US government (in this case) is trying to manipulate the mechanism of the ""invisible hand"" by providing exit solutions to those impacted 
 The US government bailout programmes can ultimately cause issues with the National debt level, speed up the next bubble economy, and perhaps from the ethical point of view where inequality is obvious in the US but the government rather spend money to bail out the elite class"
6742,"The assumption could be that comparable companies, and therefore their business, have been correctly valued 
 In the case of sector bubbles multiple-based valuation methods could drive to erroneous conclusions since peers and probably the company itself don't have their value reflected in their share price (inlfated during a bubble) 
  At the same time in case of strong macroeconomic events like financial crisis the opposite scenario would realize 
 In case a company has reported a lost the P/E would be theoretically zero and the investor is buying a company that is loosing money"
3951,"Ideally, my preferred ratio of gold in a portfolio would be zero 
 Gold itself is not an investment since it does not yield any cashflow and does not grow 
 I don't suddenly have 11 gold coins out of 10 some time later 
 However, I see a small portion of gold useful as a hedge 
 In certain unwelcome scenarios gold would perform very well 
 A ratio of 5-10% seems useful 
 In the current era of high debt, money printing and the questionable US-dollar standard I tend towards the upper end of 10%"
5184,"Hi Ong, You are right in your analysis 
 Leverage is risky 
 I think the point Michel wanted to make is that you cannot determine the whole risk (""global risk"") of a portfolio only by looking at its leverage 
 You have to look at what type of assets were bought with that borrowed money 
 Also, what does ""high"" leverage mean 
 Some might say a leverage of 2:1 is huge 
 At the very end of its existence, LTCM had a leverage of 250:1 
 With such a high leverage (and as you pointed out), very small changes in the value of the assets you have in your portfolio can drive you out of business, just like LTCM 
 Best regards, Jonas"
469,"If your growth is greater than your cost of capital, then your equation (and hence the calculated value of your firm) will diverge, i.e 
 Go to infinity 
 The single equation we use to calculate the terminal value that has (wacc - gcf) is derived using the assumption that wacc > gcf.  Hence if that assumption is violated, then the results are meaningless 
 If you write out the first N terms of the infinite series for the value of the firm, you will see that each term grows larger instead of shrinking 
 So, you have a supposed infinitely valued firm 
 Only Google and Apple are infinitely valued (or so sometimes it appears)"
4229,"Depending on one’s appetite for risk, gold may or may not be\na suitable addition to one’s portfolio 
 To an average investor whose goal is to\ncapture growth brought about by stock appreciation and dividend payouts, gold\nmay not even be an attractive option 
 I would invest only a relatively small\npart of my portfolio in precious metals – for the simple reason that the\nlikelihood of a wildly extreme event (such as political upheaval) is much slimmer\nthan the wildly volatile price of gold due to the changing sentiments of its\npatrons 
 By choosing the right companies/investment vehicles to invest in, I\ncan still ensure my portfolio is protected, rather than hoping for a precious\nmetal to appreciate in value by some anticipated demand in the future 
 But for\nthe sake of diversification, putting money in precious metals should still not\nbe summarily dismissed because they have their merits too. I choose to use “precious\nmetals” because gold is not the only one there is"

3913,"I do think that it is vital for an economy when there is high liquidity in the credit market 
 But establishing credit liquidity by cleaning out troubled assets is a very dangerous way central banks have chosen 
 Many of these banks were involved in high risk speculations, maybe even illegal (unmoral at least) practices that eventually led to the 2008 crisis 
 By bailing out the very banks that were at the forefront of this global crisis, there is no way, in my opinion, decision makers in the financial industry may question their actions 
 It is such a risky game and losing at it can lead to devastating losses, usually for the tax payer 
 As such, when banks are risking to drag down whole economies, they should be punished and not rewarded by unwinding the terrible mistakes they did"

780,"Clearly not a solution to the core of the missfunction on the system, banks finally where reckless as investors (apparently victims, but not bank’s but ignorance victims) they can spend days comparing products like TVs or fridges but not knowing what financial assets are they purchasing with their savings) so, they must let banks fail if they don’t do their homework and instead bailout household endeared or the investor cheated 
 In the end, the 2007-2008 crisis was just the tip of the iceberg, one can not expect that time can cure the desease if you just kicked the cab down the road"
690,"I believe both are true - the TARP in the US was necessary to forestall a total meltdown, as the banking industry is heavily consolidated and ""too big to fail"" 
  However, banks have not been held fully accountable for their risky activities, in particular the bundling of bad loans in with ""good"" loans and securitizing these loans with an inaccurate risk profile 
 Fortunately the situation is better now as banks have been required to be more heavily capitalized to better withstand shocks 
 I do like the idea of clawing back bonuses of execs who make bad decisions and defraud the public 
 It seems these people are rewarded no matter how badly they perform, or how many people they hurt 
 I do wonder if we would have been better off giving some TARP money directly to taxpayers, as many banks held onto substantial amounts of the TARP money rather than loaning it out as intended 
 Mortgage restructuring programs were also not helpful for most people who were ""underwater"" on their mortgages (i.e 
 The loan was bigger than the market value of the house) - these restructured loans were difficult to get, took months for approval, and were undercut by scam artists promising to ""help"" the process 
 The housing market is still not fully recovered - while home values have somewhat rebounded, huge numbers of foreclosures are still working their way through the system"

 Instead of too big to fail, maybe we should have too big to exist"
6584,"The bail out was not the right thing to do

 The fact that governments saved and bailed out certain banks and big companies does not mean that they will do it again 
 Especially because now they have more experience in dealing with such problems and they are able to see how those companies and banks, that were bailed out, are behaving

6726,"If one searches investment Banks positions on gold, he/she would see that there is a very conservative percentage of exposure (for ex 
 1.25%) in Gold (Goldman Sachs, 2016), because the price of Gold is extremely volatile 
 Now, having said that I would hold such a percentage, close to 1.25%, as a last island resort/ a repository, such as the necessary requirement that the ECB obliges European countries to have 
 And this is because if all other holdings in one's portfolio fail, which is highly improbable, there will be the holdings of gold left, because no matter their price fluctuation, they will always hold some value"
6508,"I do not believe in a perfect economic system and for me any economy can have a systemic fault within itself 
 ""Invisible hand"" that governs the markets can also create problems for the markets and I do not think  that they should be left still uncheck if the economic crisis goes catastrophic 
 If we have a concept like ""too big to fail"" already, it is not much if the government purchases assets in a time of emergency to reactivate the capital flow 
 At the end, hard times demand hard measures 
 Yet, there is this dilemma in the economic system 
 In a system where the big institutions tend to get bigger, more people depend on their existence as their gravity increases everywhere in the market 
 At that point, employment, investment, economic growth and production depend too much on them, hence governments cannot ignore their fall 
 Yet, in a free market, governments cannot intervene with their operations in order to curb their profits, growths or investment 
 At the end, most of the things depend on the central banks and such government measures as mentioned in the title 
 I see it in this way: should governments do something when private sector needs support or should they left to go through a natural selection or the survival of the fittest"

 Multiples are mainly used to make comparisons of relative value 
 They swhw where a company is at a current  time, but do not to reflect dynamic and changing nature of business and competition Mulltuples show patterns in relative values, but not absolute values such as those obtained from discounted cash flow valuations 
 Additonally they are based on historic data or near-term forecasts

473,"Along with the bailout, the US government impose more regulations on the banks and it's probably not productive to compare an entire sector of the economy to something like a spoiled candy-eating baby 
 Both, the government and the private sector made mistakes leading up to the crises and the bailout hasn't been completely one-sided in the financial sector's favour 
 In the end though, the biggest loser haven't been banks of the government but consumers and the working class who have seen their wealth shrink and wages stagnate"

 Though I believe TARP was essential in avoiding economic slowdown, the long-term impact it sends to financial sector is not clear 
 If the Fed is using TARP and if economic agents assume it would do the same then they might not take proper caution to avoid such problems in the future 
 Striking the proper balance between getting proper incentives to the financial industry to avoid such risks and at the same time reducing the effects of such regulations on economic growth is a difficult question but needs to be addressed carefully"

 P/E ratios are the exception for valuating investments but used in case of start ups or early stage companies 
 There you have negative cash flows and DCF makes no sense 
 But P/E ratios should only be applied by companies of the same industry or sector at the same stage of development and with a similar financing structure 
 To find these data is not so easy and it can be quite misleading

1655,"I agree with the point that the US government's bailout was necessary in order to ensure that the condition of the economy did not detoriate further from recession to depression 
 Although the US government intervened through TARP, it was done as a temporary measure since the programme closed down by end of 2014 when all the stake of US Treasury in those banks were sold off. Moving forward, lessons should be drawn from such events and adequate precautionary measures should be taken in order to avoid repetition while bailout should only come as a last resort with conditions attached"
7464,"The immediate action (bailing out the banks) was a good decision as it clearly saved everybody (not only banks but also common people that borrowed in a more or less extent) 
  The problem is that the bailout never stopped, instead it just got reshaped in other policies 
 In this context, the central banks transformed from heroes into villains, effectively diverting tax money paid by regular people and giving them freely to banks and corporations which effectively do not pay any taxes (because they have an army of lobbyists, lawyers and safe haven places to help them avoid them) 
  The consequences are in a timely order: 1) increased income inequality leading to 2)  global anger and discontent of large populations leading to 3) unusual political decisions aimed to ""correct"" the system leading to 4) political and social instability leading to 5) war. As usual in the human history (because of course, this is not the first time we are going through this)  we can still do something about it and avoid the catastrophic outcomes of war.

 It seems that the measure has worked, for which I am glad 
 However, CBs should prevent the misbehaviour and careless strategies of banks and financial institutions, by stepping in and impose harder regulations in terms of lending policies 
 Yes, CB stepped in and saved the day, but it should come at a price for those institutions that were bailed out,  otherwise lessons will not be learnt 
 Financial institutions are so focused and eager to make a juicy profit, that usually forget the implications of their financial strategies in the long run.  My proposal:  1) Bailed out institutions should invest X% of their profits from 2010 onward on a housing program nation-wide, providing decent homes to those affected by the crash, at a low cost 
 2) Government should develop a financial coaching program (including TV ads) targeting mainly low and middle-class, to educate borrowers on the perks and cons of getting loans, resolving primarily one simple and usually overlooked question: ""do you really needed, or it is just a whim?"""

 The ratios provide the easy way to calculate the fair value but they may not be fair in the cases when we compare well performing companies with a non-performing ones or when we compare non-performing ones to the good performers 
 According to me we can use a new approach to calculate the fairness of the ratio based methods -    Taking  the average of the P/E ratio (or the other ratio in consideration) of the companies contributing (maximum to minimum) 66.6% in that particular business 
 Then we can do the same thing for the next 33.4% contributors

5519,"Of course, we cannot use the P/E ratio on companies that have negatives earnings 
 We cannot have a negative multiple 
 It would not make sense 
 So in this case, there clearly is still value to a company 
 But if you were to use a negative P/E to a value a company, you would get a negative value, and that is just nonsense 
 Also, even if we are comparing two companies that are very similar, one could still have a much large P/E ratio than another 
 For example, what if company A bought back a lot of stock to increase their EPS? Company B would have a lower EPS than A, even if financials are very similar 
 This would then lower the P/E ratio of company A 
 If you were to try to estimate company B's stock value using company A's P/E 
 You can have a very different valuation than what company B should be worth"

3902,"Yes, I would hold small amount gold in my portfolio 
 However, I would hold gold ETF rather than actual gold"
783,"The bailout by itself was not necessarily a bad idea 
 For the larger good of the economy and people's well being, getting things moving was critical to not have another great depression 
 But, for as much effort the government put into bailing the banks, they didn't much done in terms of prosecuting the people involved or setting stronger standards to avoid predatory lending 
 I understand white collar crimes like this are hard to prosecute, but how many of the same practices that got us into the mess in the first place are still happening and being conducted by the same people as ten years ago"
4905,"The assumption is that the market prices the stocks correctly, in time of high market (like in the  _domain_  and the sub-prime market crashes) 
  this is because in most of the times when investors are very optimistic they tend to overvalue stocks"
1928,"I am seriously worried about the fact that government take actions in favour of banks instead of common people 
 A government should always elict less powerful people when selecting who should receive protection"
1831,"This is assuming that the other comparable companies are fairly valued 
 Historically, at the peak of a bull market, when the entire stock market may be overvalued, this is not a good assumption 
 For example, during the tech bubble or the real estate bubble, we would not have a good fairly valued comparable company 
 For companies that just reported a loss, it might be difficult to use the most recent data 
 The companies might be going to an unusual circumstance or might be going through more serious problems 
 In that case, it might be difficult to decide if the companies at a loss are a more accurate reflection of the current industry or if they are the exception"
1447,"I think it is too early to tell, but it does give a signal to banks that any lending is OK."
1560,"Hi, i am Elizabeth also from South Africa 
 Nice to know that there is someone who share the same mind set is close by"
315,"The assumption is that all conditions are equal amongst the companies and does not consider all of the important factors driving the results 
 Two examples: A company could have reported negative earnings not because of lower cash flows but because of loss provisions (that did not occur and maybe will not, which are booked later as a profit if the losses do not occur) 
  Maybe the company that is booking loss provisions is more prudent than the others that did not, but it's prudency may lower it's market value as a result 
 Other companies may sell their future receivables not yet collected in order to boost their quarterly income now, so that they might appear to be better performing than comparable companies, but that performance over a longer period may not be superior to the comparable companies"
2117,"One of the risks of using multiple-based valuation methods is that earnings of a given company can be a result of one-shot accident (for example selling of useless property) 
  Multiplying such ""tweaked' earnings by P/E ratio of a comparable company can simply lead to overvaluation"
7316,"Really good responses by Markim and Cesar 
 Hi Bassma Thanks for posting this important question 
 I would like to add some more to the above explanations in the context of Financial Securities 
 A benchmark is a standard against which the performance of a security, mutual fund or investment manager can be measured 
 Generally, broad market and market-segment stock and bond indexes are used for this purpose 
 For more details please check the following link 
 If you google it, then you'll get plenty of articles on this area 
 Really appreciate if you could research and then post what you gathered from there 
 It would improve our knowledge as well 
 Thanks, Chaturaka"

 \n \n Thanks\n \n A-M"
3646,Depends on the risk appetite
2788,\n\nI'm more worried about the potential consequences of this bailout in terms of bad ncentives for banks
6603,I am more worried about the potential consequences of this bailout in terms of bad incentives for banks
1271,There is the assumption that you are comparing similar companies in similar situations
1454,"We assume that the value of the comparable companies are correct 
 In the period before the tech bubble in the begin of the century or the short period before the banking crises due to overvalued properties 
 In all these cases the ratio's must have given a wrong value 
 If similar companies reported losses it is important to investigate how these losses have been accumilated 
 This could have many reason not related to performance of the company 
 However if it is z market trent it is something that cannot be ignored"
2712,I think it was necessary at that particular time
977,"Using such ratios as price to earnings to value the company can be tricky, because its based on the assumptions that values of comparable firms assessed correctly, their earnings were stable (there were no loss years  or major investments that can affect average earnings) and risks are the same"
1087,"Similar financial risks 
 During the global financial crisis 
 One cannot use them"
9132,Yes the bailout of its financial sector was simply necessary for the well being of economy for the US government because reviving the economy from financial crisis is the utmost tough target for any government it can control the potential consequences by changing the interest rates
1911,"I think that government's bad incentives are more important, because in the long run it will overcome the short term benefits"
3523,"I would prefer to hold a small part of my asset in gold in order to hedge again black swan cases and at the same time, be able to favor (in the lond run) from the return in other assets"
921,"US Government did what was required at that moment, when financial backbones (financial sector and banks) start falling down, they have to give support 
 If they hadn't done that, we would have had major recession 
 US Gov wanted to have a good money supply and maintain growth, if bank stop landing then people cannot do business 
 Money is like an oil in the economy, if there is less oil you will have a rough ride and more noise 
 By maintaining stability of financial sector by bailing them out US Gov did good 
 Now questions comes would they bailout everyone next time it occurs, for that they would have to have some kind of guidelines and follow that"
278,"What I think is gold also can only serve as a hedge against extreme events until certain point 
 It might happen that access to food, fresh water, and firearms is more valuable than gold in some circumstances 
 Of course even at those times having some gold wouldn't hurt 
 Other types of assets are apparently also to certain extent hedge each other against extreme events, for example cache hedges against stock market crashes, and stock market hedges against inflation 
 It's also not exactly free to keep gold once it's obtained, and buying and selling it might be subject to fees and taxes 
 Given conciderations above I wouldn't probably have large part of my portfolio in gold"
6334,"When there are large depreciations in the commodity market (such as oil), or in the real estate business, or natural tragedies, it is no longer safe to evaluate a firm only with the price to earnings"
1242,"The assumption is that ratios such as price-to-earnings is accurate to value other comparable companies; however, the price-to-earnings ratio varies company to company as earnings are different for each respective company and the price may be inflated based on expected earnings such as in the case of Tesla 
 I have not felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value technology stocks as the multiples tend to be inflated and not representative of current profit and many times have negative earnings 
 For companies that report a loss the multiple based valuation method is not as accurate as the discounted cash flow valuation as the DCF valuation includes the previous years which may have positive earnings"
2456,"I think the actions taken by the Govts (& central banks) were necessary when the crisis 'erupted' 
   The actions were decisive and in a large extent worked effectively in containing the crisis and we saw a swift recovery post 2009 
 As we have learnt, stimulating a recovery / growth is much harder than cooling down the economy, the drastic measures were required to provide confidence to the markets or otherwise, it would have been much harder to claw our way out of a major crisis 
 While we recognize that some of the measures have not been rolled back, especially the unprecedented and historically low interest rate environment, I believe the central banks are waiting for the economy to stand on a stronger footing and then act to gradually increase interest rates 
 We are seeing excess and some bubbles in the equities and property markets but it is easier, as we have learnt in this course, to cool down the economy by increasing interest rates, regulating certain 'excess/bubble' sectors, restricting money flow and/or reducing/tweaking fiscal spending / policies moving forward when the economy is standing on sound footing 
 There are efforts already taken by Governments around world to specifically assist to cool down certain sectors (especially the property sector) and implement stress tests and related banking regulations to ensure Banks are on sound footing 
 I think it is a matter of time, rates will gradually rise in line with economic growth and stability 
 With the recent crisis and with previous crises, Governments are learning and innovating in their approaches to manage and prevent future crises"
2070,"Sometimes multiple-based valuation methods might not be accurate, especially during a bubble 
 For instance comparing different tech companies during the  _domain_  bubble would not be able to provide an accurate fair value"
512,I think benefits of the bailout were bigger than bad incentives for banks
4797,15% of my portfolio should be secured by gold
5587,"Typically take multiples that are operating in the same industry in order to make sure that I have a similar operating risk 
 And we should also try to take firms that are in the similar stage of development, meaning that they have the same expected growth rate 
 In addition, if you want to use the price earnings ratio, we should also make sure that the firms have a similar financial risk 
 Yes!  Have to understand the reasons for a loss, maybe it has just a big investment in its assets"
3762,"That assumption could be, that companies are trade at a fair value in the short term 
 Further the general rule applies, namely that the companies should be from the same industry with the comparable financing structure.\n Using multiple-based valuation could be a bad choice, if the macroeconomic environment in a particular region changes or some unexpected policy and decisions are taken 
 Both aspects could have a significant influence on a short-term as well as a long-term ability of the companies to grow 
 Therefore the multiple-based valuation could disfigure a real value of respective companies and their stock price in the momentum of change 
 \n A similar approach applies for companies that just reported a loss 
 Although the multiples of such companies will be negatively affected in the moment they reported a loss, the constant yearly growth rate as well as future free cash flow could be very attractive 
 So that the DCF-based valuation would provide more verified results compared to a multiple-based valuation"
1177,"I would invest around 10% of my porfolio in Gold because valuation of the stock exchange in the US is very high and the risk of a black swan is growing 
 More fundamentaly I think the action of Central Banks which are increasing the supply of money dramatically will result in a ketchup effect and ultimately relaunch the inflation 
 There are also political risks that are pleading to detain a limited share of Gold in the portfolio"
1526,"I would invest relatively small part because I can choose assets in such a way that they would be both more rewarding than gold and rather stable 
 However some part of my portfolio would be in gold as soon as I understand that it’s stable  and can hedge risks"
5807,"I agree with the decision of US government 
 First of all, the government must make sure that national economy runs well 
 This task obviously includes preventing it from any types of crisis 
 Secondly, at the time of subprime crisis, immediate actions are urgently required due to the recovery of the economy 
 The threat to US economy is imminent 
 Therefore, US government must intervene adequately 
 Thirdly, without government's bailout, the banks might not be able to clean up their toxic assets by themselves 
 If even they can, it could take longer 
 Concerning an arguments that it can make banks to repeat the mistakes again, I would say further analysis and measurements must be sufficiently taken to prevent such an issue from happening again in the future"
4572,"The answer should mostly reside on the characteristics of the numerous black swans that we want to take into account 
 First of all, you would want to make sure that the worst-case scenario which is impacting your portfolio as a whole, can be balanced by the potential gains the gold would make within such context 
 That's the actuarial, statistical approach 
 But that's not all. Gold can indeed act as a prominent hedge against multiple financial risks, yet it is far from alone 
 Frontier vehicles such as art or wine may also provide a respectable hedge under similar and perhaps wider-contexted environments and, therefore, limits the extent to which gold may take a share of an efficient portfolio 
 Furthermore, gold is so prominent in financial history that it confers it some disadvantages: the political risks 
 Indeed, nation states can consider gold reserves as strategic and part of their national security, therefore access to gold may be restricted, and governments may even seize gold assets for political motives 
 Last but not least, there are some black swan scenarios that themselves involve high risk for the value of gold itself 
 My favourite one is probably the advent of fin-tech and cryptocurrency 
 If a virtual-based asset class becomes a genuinely secure way to hedge against the same risks that gold is supposed to counter, then market psychology might finally consider gold as a mere commodity, like nickel, and therefore all of its financial appeals may just be replaced by the virtually-issued one. All of this taken into context makes it so that gold does not longer represent a fascinating hedge or any form of long-term insurance 
 I would, therefore, simply use it as another asset class like bonds, stocks, currencies and so forth 
 That is, with its risks and rewards, but no longer the same view that history regards it so"
4425,"Assuming I can always ensure a good living standard through my regular income, my portfolio would be predominantly in equities 
 Gold is a good store of value, but good companies can produce value"
5474,"The bail out of the financial sector was necessary 
 Our world would not of have been able to survive another Great Depression 
 However, the government should be expected to provide another bail out for banks careless and lucrative investment activities 
 Big banks must be watched more carefully now, but I do think TARP was necessary in 2008"
4710,"If diversification is the key to a sensible risk vs reward portfolio, then holding some gold must make sense 
 It hedges against a great many events 
 Maybe 5% of a portfolio as an insurance 
 However, risky investments lead to higher returns in the long run, so if we are looking to a long horizon then the sensible action would be to look for triggering events that lead to substantially moving a portfolio into gold for a shorter period 
 Holding gold at all times merely reduces your wider returns 
 Gold ETFs must have made accessing a gold backed security much more straight-forward, so fast action, rather than holding a pot, would be my preference"
3713,"Performance of silver is dependent om the economy a lot more than gold 
 Silver is used in many industries, so when stocks crash, silver also crashes"
8131,10% gold 20% stock market 70% Crude Oil
4966,"Good question 
 Okay, maybe it was necessary at that point, i'm not sure yet. But what I'm sure about is that this state intervention gave a really bad incentive for banks and created a moral hazard, because now the bankers/banks are sure that no matter what they do somebody will come and save them 
 And they are sure in that not only because the US government did the bailout, but because they know that they are a essential part of every economy 
 I personally am against that kind of state intervention, i am more Milton Friedman type of economist and i believe that state intervention of any kind (war, and generally people safety not included) is unnecessary, because those actions create a false sense of security for people generally"
4494,"Taking  into account the lessons, I'd invest a 50% in gold from my portfolio because of markets are strongly volatile"
8415,Relatively small part
4959,"While I do believe that the financial sector's bailout was necessary at the time, I am more worried about the potential consequences of this bailout in terms of bad incentives for banks as the bailout has reaffirmed that some firms and lending institutions have become too big to fail which implies that in the long term, these firms might adopt more predatory practices and neglect to take into account their balance sheet"
1614,"It would be determined by my retirement time frame 
 If im gonna retire really soon, i may place a large portion in gold 
 On the other hand if i have 20-30 yrs before retirement then only a small portion"
1799,I'm more worried about the potential future consequences (moral hazard) of this bailout in terms of bad incentives for the banks
803,"Living in Brasil in a scenario of increasing inflation and the failure of the government and central bank policies to contain it, i would allocate at least 10-15% in gold in my portfolio, besides other hedge options like multimarket funds and investments in dollar and euro currency in cash"
9164,"Yes, I would worry for future, bank behavior being ethical  or not"
