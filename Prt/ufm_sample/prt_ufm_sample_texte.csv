3279,Unnecessary
6814,I'm much more worried about the bad incentives this action produced
5896,"Lorric, Dave  As per Beta testing instructions, the e-mail to be in contact in case of need:  Please do not hesitate to reach out to us by emailing   if you need any further guidance or had a question not covered in the document"
6547,"In DCF of course there are a lot of assumptions 
 However, in the multiples based valuation, we also assume that the company we are evaluating is going to do exactly the same as the comparable one. There is one industry, but there is no identical twin company in the industry"
7354,"Suppose the correct Terminal Value is 6000 million USD (i.e 
 Discard your answer to the previous question), what is the price of 1 share of XYZ using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation method 
 Please give your answer in USD and round it to the nearest integer 
 For example, if your answer is 17 USD, then type in ""17"""
6783,I would just purchase a small amount of gold and let it sat alone on my portfolio for a while
8619,Relatively small
2882,"I think it was necessary 
 While the government's bailout may encourage reckless lending, many of the US's most successful industries (examples include tech startups in Silicon Valley) are high risk and reliant on borrowing 
 Leaving these troubled assets in banks' balance sheet would've also driven consumption down, slowing the economy further 
 While bailouts may not be the best option in other economies, the USA is what some would call ""too big to fail"""
7812,"Will Warren Buffett's selection of the Vanguard S&P 500 beat a selection of hedge funds 
 Origination of the bet:        Warren Buffett quote 
 “The hedge fund managers have done very well over that period,” Mr Buffett said, noting that, on a notional $1bn portfolio, they would have made $20m in management fees “just for coming to the office 
 The investors in the hedge funds have paid a very big price.”"
3025,"One should only value the companies comparable in terms of size of assets, debt, investment grade, etc"
5263,"Using a multiple or ratio for evaluation purpose expects that the multiple is based on profound market research, which requires a quality selection of the peer used and more importantly actual data 
 In times of market turmoil or situations with a high uncertainty (e.g 
 Financial crisis in 2008), using a multiple-based valuation method can be cumbersome and error prone 
 A quality multiple integrates positive and negative earnings"
3551,"I would have a significant part (~20%) of my investments parked in gold 
 Gold being a natural hedge to various other asset classes as discussed in the previous lectures, I believe, it is imperative for one to make gold a part of ones portfolio"
2295,"If I take investing in gold as an insurance policy, I would not consider to have more than 20% of gold in my portfolio 
 It might be enough in order to safeguard from the negative impact that extreme events may create"
727,"Bailouts can perhaps provide relief in the short term, but they may push the problem down the road and compound the problem"
6925,"I think that the ""TARP"" was necessary otherwise there would have been a prolonged recession 
 The government should also increase regulation so that such event does not occur again"
8374,"I would have a relatively small part in gold and in addition have real estate as another hedge to ensure some reasonable quality of life (a place to live) and also have assets that can be relatively easily liquidated, if not for an optimal return"
5396,Invest a little bit in gold
488,"Gold is a proxy for cash but with inflation proofing abilities, therefore it would seem to make sense to hold cash in the form of gold at the same proportion that you would typically hold cash 
 There is of course a cost to liquidation of gold that may not exist with cash plus the insurance costs of holding gold 
 With that being said, I would be inclined to hold between 5 and 15% in gold depending on the global stability outlook 
 Given the current outlook I would tend towards the higher end of this estimate"
4880,"If my portfolio was heavily weighed in foreign currency denominated assets I would choose a higher weight of gold to hedge against currency risk, political risk and liquidity risk 
 If I were weighed more by assets in my local currency I would choose a lower weight in gold unless I observe monetary policy changes in order to stimulate the economy"
8528,I would start small and increase or decrease the amount depending on the volatility of the overall market
5376,"Investing in Gold as an insurance, I will be comfortable with 20% max. This provides enough insurance at the same time allows me to use the opportunity to invest in other assets were the returns (and risk) are higher"
6231,"It was essential to bailout those banks otherwise we would have seen more panic across the globe which would have caused sell offs 
 But while bailing out existing troubled assets rules must be laid out to regularize and control the lending going forward"
6707,"The assumption is that market is fairly evaluating similar companies and that we are not in a market bubble period where all companies are over priced 
 Dotcom (2000-2002) and housing (2007 -2009) market bubbles are the more recent examples of a period where related companies where dangerously overpriced before market collapse 
 Reporting a single loss doesn’t mean the company is not healthy, its performance should be instead considered in the long term 
 Figures of a company experiencing a single negative event shouldn’t be used as a reference to evaluate another one"
7803,"I believe at the very beginning QE 1 was a good move, but since then, QE2 and QE3, but some CEO of the banks received bonus because they can help the bank to borrow money, and I believe further QE were wrong"
2450,"Companies often ""play"" their various reports, so simply looking at statistics can be misleading"
2468,Potential consequences of bailout definitely
3989,"I believe that it assumes that it is fair to use the same P/E between the comparable companies 
 Companies with negative P/E, should certainly not be bought"
1046,"I agree, it's introductory and it needs to keep simple 
 It's just that I've been teaching that kind of things to teenagers, so I thought nobody would fall into the -50% / +50% trap at university level 
 Maybe I'm wrong."
3767,Can anyone explain me about convertible bonds
4841,"I think the hardest part in using multiples-based method is that it is a very hard task to find an identical, comparable companies, especially when speaking of the tech industry that makes innovative products, their products in most of the time are not able to compare with another, which leads to inaccuracy when we use multiples-based method"
2595,I would have a proportional smaller amount in gold but enough to have an insurance in case an unpredicted event happens
512,I think benefits of the bailout were bigger than bad incentives for banks
4278,"After Bailout by the US Government for Banks, Federal Bank has kept more control on the financial strength of all those banks in US 
 The Incentives are very much required to create positive vibes in the Economy to strengthen financial markets"
4252,"I am not experienced at all on these valuation methods 
 But I think multiple-based valuation is quite subjective 
 I don't think it is that easy to find a comparable company for the valuation 
 In addition, we have seen a lot of creative accounting that affect all those ratios used for valuations 
 It is not an easy call I believe"
4259,"We assume that the ratios come from honest data 
 Take Enron for example, they cooked their books 
 During the  housing crisis it turned out vast amounts of risk was hidden to the point large investment houses and bank were or close to insolvent 
 Additionally, in relation to negative earnings and such, different companies are at different stages and operate with different amounts of risk do to a vast amount of variables 
 We need to consider these variables when making any assessment 
 Maybe this company just reported a loss, but they could have made a large investment in technological capital or settled a lawsuit that will clear the way higher future earnings 
 The simple answer is there are no simple answers 
 Information is king, so get as much as you can"
3998,"We assume that the companies in the market are at fair value, that is the market or the sector overall is not over valued or undervalued"
6709,"It's hard to answer with universal number 
 I think it depends on several factors: investment horizon, risk tolerance, portfolio risk 
 It feels like the more you ready to take risk the less you need a hedge 
 From the other hand, insurance should worth much less than portfolio itself 
 I'm looking forward for the video explaining how to calculate hedge size"
2222,"The gold weighting in portfolio should depend on the person's risk profile (seeking income, close to retirement etc) 
  As a younger investor I might put 10 percent to gold, and 10 to cash"
6316,"I would have a minimal amount 
 Clearly these events happen but their frequency is not enough to offset the opportunity cost in the long term"
7646,"Hi Dibya 
 I'm sure that even if you have annual growth just slightly higher than inflation rate, you can easily find single stocks that perform much better than stock indexes 
 For example Polish stock market is lower than 5 years ago but there're many stocks that are 20, 50, 100, 200 or even 900% higher 
 So my advice would be to focus (especially in the longer term) on single stocks with prospects for high growth rather than overall stock market"
6334,"When there are large depreciations in the commodity market (such as oil), or in the real estate business, or natural tragedies, it is no longer safe to evaluate a firm only with the price to earnings"
7719,"Hello  Robert, Can you help me with the outcome of questions 3 and 5 of the second week Quiz, please 
 I have difficulties to solve them 
 Thank you. Rafael Tárrega"
5889,"Compared to European choices,  us policies has been the right answer to the crisis , but this of course could trigger new booble and moral hazard behavior 
 The economy it is not an exact science and history would never be the same 
 Finally, usa as a financial culture more focused on the opportunity than on the riskies, the future is uncertain in both case"
5217,"I would be concerned about comparables from companies that may be operating under some unfair advantage or even fraud, and a ""black swan"" incident, i.e 
 Enron could cause losses to one assuming that there are no other factors in the company's success than fair market returns"
1695,"It's Fat Tail and not Fat K 
 Seems there is some problem with the subtitles"
4223,"One key issue that was not used in this question of the use of gold in portfolio construction and that was related to the time horizon of the investor 
 We have not used gold in our portfolios due to our long term hold strategy 
 We have found that by rebalancing during tops and bottoms we can reduce risks and enhance returns while staying fully invested during downturns in the markets 
 This was also true during the difficult 2008/2009 period 
 I have found that it is extremely difficult both intellectually and emotionally to predict significant downturns and reversals 
 Since this is our case if we were to hold gold it would have an opportunity cost to our portfolio 
 If we were to hold a significant percentage in gold, say 20%, to make an impact to the portfolio this would have a significant carrying and opportunity cost to the portfolio 
 Gold pays no interest and is valued only by crisis mentality demands 
 In sum, We will not use gold as a hedge but will look to other more productive instruments"
2495,"In this 2-step approach, what does the ""Investment Policy"" regard 
 The only discussion made on this approach was Client Objective > Strategic, then Tactical Asset Allocation 
 What does the Investment Policy Reference"
4739,"When using comp ratios, an assumption you are making is that the other market participants emotions are nonexistent and that people are trading off of solely numbers 
 When in fact current opinions have very much to do with price behavior 
 Depending on whether a company is in/out of favor in present time may skew the multiple above or below ""fair value"" 
   History will tell you that anytime there is a potential bubble forming, traditional valuation methods are much less effective at determining fair value sense the current divergence is driven by views of future potential growth, which can not be predicted with reasonable certainty 
 Negative earnings can be difficult to value similarly as the above examples 
 Technically they are worth $0, so you are paying for future growth (Amazon in US) and in return should demand a much better ROI. Side Note: trading negative cash-flow public companies may be done best by using technicals sense they are driven by emotion and many times the heard mentality 
 So charts and other indicators help determine what the heard is thinking"
6411,For Me I would invest 25% of my portfolio on Gold as an hedge insurance ( To have reduce opportunity cost and insurance against the Black Swans) and invest 75% of my portfolio on traditional asset and investments because this is what will rapidly increase my portfolio when black swans don't happen
1534,I think you can take the tests but you verified them
2957,Only Stock markets
2429,"I think that the US government has also added many measures to cap the capacity of bankers to make moves that will affect the economy in such extreme measures as previous times 
 In all things only time will tell the true outcome of these measures"
7240,"Hi Victor, I've also completed the test but the question at issue is the NPV calculation where I could not get a correct answer to the question 
 Any help appreciated 
 Thanks"
8578,Small portion of investment
2422,"It actually depends on the risk appetite of the investor 
 If I were an investor I would possible invest on the stocks which gives higher return than the gold"
5264,"In my opinion the P/E ratio is only as used as the figures on which the ratio is based on 
 If a company's listed price is undervalued or overvalued or if the earnings are not accurate the ratio will be of a lesser quality"
967,"I'd rather have a small amount of my portfolio invested in gold because as much as i'd love to have a high amount of gold, i need more returns also and hence i'd have to invest in stock and bonds and well we all know business is all about taking risk and making predictions 
 Hence, if i invest a large part of my portfolio in gold for a particular period of time, and then there's still no situation then i'd have a huge regret"
6610,"Yes, I would relatively have a large part of my portfolio invested in gold at some times as an insurance, seeing it could be more secure than other forms of investment like bond and stock"
8221,More than 5%
1093,Bailout was necessary
8233,"With so many short videos, the constant introduction graphics does become annoying 
 Perhaps combine videos together - perhaps a minimum of 10 minute video clips"
78,"In my portfolio gold would take about 10% of all investments at all times 
 I prefer more risky assets with expected higher returns 
 However, at todays market situation a part of gold would probably increase"
8121,"If i were an investor I'd consider two moments: 1 
 The market where I'm going to invest money which brings us to the RISK notion 
 2 
 Time period 
 Assuming I'm trading on emerging markets I'd use 40/60 proportion: 40% in gold, 60% - in other financial instruments (bonds, stocks etc) 
  It makes sense because of high risk and volatility 
 In case of developed markets it's possible to apply 30/70 or even 20/80 share taking into consideration the low chances of unlikely events and lower risks"
8556,I would rather have a small part of a portfolio in gold at all times
205,It may have been necessary but it's unclear if there were any long-term benefits to this approach
3955,"I dont feel comfortable to use multiple-based valuation method alone at all. for some countries and business might be lack of info or existed indicators are not relevant 
 Besides to get a fair value both proposed methods are not fully comprehensive, they count only cash flow factors, but there are others such as political, risk, etc. Wich i think should be taken into account for share value estimate"
118,"There is a moral hazard issue here 
 The germ of the next crisis could be germinating since banks do not pay for their mistakes 
 However, considering the Japan case and its consequences, by failing to take a similar decision, the decision is correct and it is expected that other tools are used to mitigate moral hazard"
5267,"Hi Winifred, your steps are all correct, but you haven't round the number to nearest integer as the question required"
5191,A 10% allocation of the overall portfolio into gold should be reasonable both for the purpose of asset diversification and risk mitigation
203,"Hello 
 Just a quick question: for how long can do i have the access to my learning materials (lecture slides, videos, quizzes)"
4082,"The assumption in using ratios is that the companies are comparable 
 There are a lot of examples that companies in a cohort have not developed as the other members in the cohort 
 As today's valuations of companies, which do promise in the future positive cash flows, sometimes very large future positive cash flows, a today negative earning is to the investor community not much a concern 
 The community expects something valuable in the future and wants to participate on that"
2399,"Both 
 I suspect that the situation would have been a lot worse without the TARP bailout and Quantitative Easing 
 On the other hand, I think that they have increased the moral hazard by bailing out the banks and financial institutions 
 Ultimately, I think the next financial disaster will be a lot worse because of these actions"
2410,"When we use ratios observed on the market, we make an assumption that the market correctly values the stock prices of the compared set of companies 
 However, the companies considered may be undervalued or overvalued (the dot com bubble)    PE valuation methodology cannot be used to value companies whose earnings are negative 
 - companies may have short- term / temporary problems resulting in negative earnings that do not reflect the potential of their business to evolve in the future 
 - new projects/ companies are likely to generate negative earnings initially but represent a huge potential in the future"
7423,"Some reasons I thought of: 1)There may not be comparable companies 
 2) If earnings is close to zero, the formula doesn't work, mathematically 
 3) The earnings reports may not be up to date when you decide to invest"
5304,"Hi Alex, Welcome to the Investment Management specialization

4245,I think that trouble assets in future can be limited by the Central Banks to prevent future bailouts
6725,"My Name is Dennis Mojica and I am a computer technician 
 I am taking this class to be able to understand and manage my business 
 This is my first MOOC and I look forward to learning more"
4657,It is important to see the trend for the specific segment the company operates
927,"The assumption is, that the other companies we use for the multiples, are correctly valued by the market 
 In historic periods like crashes (financial crisis) and bubbles (dotcom bubble) most companies might be incorrectly valued for a long period of time 
 Furthermore there are never two companies which are exactly the same, so multiples are also just rough approximations to the values"
3488,"I believe that the US Government (and others around the World) bailout of  its financial sector plagued by troubled non-performing assets was simply necessary, because without a healthy financial sector, economic growth is impossible 
 However, the concern that this bailout somehow incentivises banks to be careless in their investment activity and risk management is not without merit 
 One way of addressing this concern is legislation mandating a certain percentage of bank profits towards a fund that can be used to repay the taxpayer and for future bailouts 
 That is bailouts are not handouts to the financial sector but loans meant to be re payed when the crisis is averted"
2421,"What could that assumption be 
 That the earnings declared by the company are correct/properly evaluated 
 Were there instances in history where you would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies 
 N.A 
 However, MBVM should be used in the framework of the same industry to compare organisation with similar growth/capital structure ect.   What about companies that just reported a loss (i.e 
 Negative earnings) 
  N.A"
7096,"Thank you for the answer 
 It's exactly what I was looking for. Best regards.\n"
120,"It was difficult to understand - how to calculate return/risk ratio 
 In the future could you provide example - how to calculate this 
 I used the link  , but in definition they explain in terms losses, stop-losses 
 And in this course this definition it's wrong"
5402,"In my opinion, the actions of the US govt 
 (and may others around the world) is a double-edged sword 
 What they have demonstrated is that the action to purchase the 'troubled assets' from financial institutions have helped the economy avert a protracted downturn 
 To prevent this action (purchase of troubled assets) from being construed as 'incentivizing' banks to be careless in their future activities and propagating reckless behaviour, the govts 
 Must place conditions upon the banks to be restructured over a period of time to correct the situation and at the same time develop an exit strategy for their (govts.) 'troubled assets' holding"
8406,I would invest relatively a small of of the portfolio in Gold
7562,"Video: what is the real value of money 
 At 08:30, CHF/EUR rate is written 
 To me, this should be EUR/CHF to match with the graph 
 In FX markets conventions, CHF/EUR means quantity of EUR for 1 CHF. And EUR/CHF means quantity of CHF for 1 EUR. The ""/"" does not mean ""per"" or ""divided by"" 
  Can anymone confirm  
  Thanks"
3350,"I would rather have a small portion of my portfolio in gold 
 Majorly to rebate the volatility of whatever percentage I have in stocks"
6137,"I would rather hold an smaller part of my portfolio invested in gold as an insurance, but ramp it up slowly as the dollar for example looses value 
 That would partially compensate for the effect of being late in a balck swan event or other, when the price of gold has already gone up significantly 
 So using the dollar as a “fever curve” to adjust to potentially higher risks would be adequate to build a better hedging position over time"
4779,"To maintain political advantage and a degree of stability, the parties that constitute the US government,  and/or others around the world, have little recourse other than to use the banking system to manufacture the growth figures, that are now not possible because of a lack of growth in new lines of productive activity 
 Like in Ireland and Greece, the electorate will not respond to an appeal to reason, unless the economic crisis makes any other route -- a Russian 1917 style revolution excepted -- impossible 
 The sudden shock of a Great Depression has been avoided 
 But that has been replaced by the slow-motion train wreck of great recession, that will take until at least 2023 to clear 
 As per von Mises and Rothbard, this liaison with the banks is a deal with the devil, but that relationship is slowly being unwound 
 Even so, the UK government, with some politicians hell bent on a BREXIT,  is as wildly over exposed to the City of London, as the Scots would have been, if they had relied on the high price of oil, to float an independent Scotland"
7102,"Adesh you're killing it my friend lol thank you again 
 Robert I think we have a lot to understand ahah"
349,"Hi Vicente, Thanks for a very good question 
 Since you are familiar with accounting, one way to look at it might be that you could value a company in a way that is similar to looking at its balance sheet 
 Perhaps the method taught in this course is similar to looking at an income statement 
 I agree though that it doesn't seem to take into account the present assets the company has, nor liabilities"
322,I believe the US government's bailout of its financial sector was necessary
3123,"The amount of gold that should be held in a portfolio is dependent on how old the investor is and also what equity and bond markets they are invested in 
 Obviously, the younger the investor, the more risk that should be taken on, which means less gold and more high returning high risk investments 
 An older investor probably should have a significant amount of gold in their portfolio 
 An investor living in a high risk area should have a larger amount of gold in their portfolio"
7122,Thanks a lot for this additional information
546,"The architects of the crash were the same people to put the bailout packages together 
 According to Noam Chomskey, financial institutions are already factoring future bailouts into their risk models, effectively justifying further reckless lending 
 The public must not pick up the tab for this"
4018,"I would like to hold 30%~40% assets in Gold in order to maintain the liquidity of cash and other asset(stock, bonds) 
  Also, when there was black swan happened, it would be still flexible to find out some other hedge fund to protect the investment"
1416,There were no such instances
5139,"In 2008, it seems that the bailout was necessary 
 In Belgium for example, the government intervene heavily for the main banks in the country 
 For one or two small banks, the government did not intervene and the customers are struggling getting their savings back 
 Intervention of the State gives a wrong incentive to banks but sometime it is the only option 
 The government should work to prevent this type of situations"
5508,"As it was stated in the beginning gold can serve as a hedge against extreme events 
 I personally wouldn't consider gold as a tool to yield something out of it 
 Mainly it can be considered as a saving account 
 With that said I would diversify my portfolio in a way that gold would take small part but enough for me to overcome the outcomes of an unlikely extreme event as an individual 
 In general it all depends on the investor's strategy 
 Bigger returns come with bigger risks and vice versa 
 If investor wants to play safe then the portion of gold in his portfolio will be bigger comparing to the one who bears risk"
7150,"Hi, does anyone have the answer to question 5 in the quiz - would like to see where I went wrong

2780,"We assume that price and earnings used in calculating P/E ratios are positive 
 Negative P/E ratios are commonly considered to be invalid or not applicable"

7338,Thanks Jaruboot
3027,"When we choose comparable firms, we have to look for firms in a similar stage of development ( expected grow rates) and with a similar financila structure"
6803,"That question brings the paramount of today's financial politics into reflexion, and I am happy to offer a tentative answer to it 
 First of all, the U.S 
 Government did not simply ""waste"" public's money with the bailouts 
 TARP program ended in a net profit for the U.S 
 Government, regrouping $441 billions out of $426 invested in a 6-years timespan 
 So the public's purse did not waste a single cent with this action, inflation accounted for. Secondly, this bailout was organised for systematically important banks only, and without so, the economy as a whole would have been put in great danger 
 Bailouts were not organised for poorly managed banks, but only those deemed at risk for the economy as a whole 
 These two points are very important to recall, because they just speak for themselves 
 It was a cost-efficient solution to respond to a highly risky situation 
 Believing that the ethical implications can outweigh the excellent solution, technically speaking, that the U.S 
 Government brought at that very time, does not seem reasonable to me 
 If it had to be done again, it surely should be the case 
 Now, picking up this side of the debate does not mean that the ethical implications should be completely offset 
 It is critical in my opinion to combine this view with a stricter approach on two dimensions 
 First, the U.S 
 Government should make sure to use the profits from TARP, minus inflation, to provide extra resources to forensic and investigative departments analysing the historical wrongdoers (in additional to their regular budget, as a sort of ""bonus"" cashflow) 
  Secondly, the implication of some key executive individuals at the systematically important institutions, is so sensitive to the wider economy and the society at large, that they should be subject to the same level of personal responsibility that judiciary, military or governmental personnel may have 
 That includes, to speak bluntly, criminal responsibility in some cases 
 As such, I strongly believe that the best answer to the current debate around public bailouts is to keep being supportive of them, to avoid at any cost a bigger crisis, while at the same time strengthening both investigative and retaliatory options against wrongdoers 
 Attempting to bear the cost on other (innocent) investors, or the public at large, does not seem to be the most ethical solution a society could wish for"
8605,Relatively small part
4462,Nope
8291,10% is too high a number dont you think
3633,"In fact it was both necessary and worrying 
 At that point in time there were simply no choice for US government not to proceed with bailout 
 Or at least that's what everyone wanted us to believe 
 In th end of the day taxpayers' money was used to solve the issue that investment banks created 
 Bailout is the right tool only in case there is no other option 
 To be sure about that we need to carefully examine each situation and have regulation tools in place in order to monitor banks and their activities 
 Without doing so there is no doubt that banks will continue their careless strategies that rely on bailout if something go wrong"
8499,"I would rather hold a small part of the portfolio in gold, about 10%"
5506,"Multiples-based valuation focus on past and misses future perspective 
 For example, a company is highly efficient and has higher sustainable growth rate should have a high PE ratio, while a bad business with even low PE could go bust and prove to be a mistake to invest it 
 On the other side, it is not easy to pick similar comparable companies 
 Last, those multiple valuation doesn't make sense when it becomes negative, e.g 
 In turn-around case, negavtive PE could be a very good investment opportunity"
2905,"In using P/E ratio- the assumption could be that the markets are rational in estimating the price of the company 
 Also the earnings reported by the company is devoid of any errors"
4588,"Both, i think it was necessary but has a trouble side affect and when lenders were issuing  loans to people that they knew couldn't afford them i don't see why that wasn't considered fraud"
3973,"To use a ratio such as P/E to value shares, the companies being compared need to be in a relatively mature earnings phase 
 Current P/E ratios are not applicable if a company is expecting a large increase or decrease in future earnings (i.e 
 A gold miner is about to open or close a mine)"
1726,"TARP was necessary to prevent a meltdown of the global financial system, and should have been a strong learning point for governments around the world to revise financial regulation 
 Whether the latter happened to a sufficient degree is yet to be seen"
6692,"I think it was a wrong idea, if there hasn't been a bailout to banks, the opportunity of new financial forms will rice and things will change not giving them the confidence that the government always go to their rescue"
3937,"I think central bank need to valuate the company  before bailout 
 Some companies are worthless to survive and it is necessary for them to be eliminated in all situations 
 The financial crisis just accelerate their life to bankruptcy 
 However, for some companies having vital function, it is necessary to bail out because they might face to the liquidity problem due to the crisis chain reaction 
 Their existence can help to rebound the economy and provide more employment on a long run. I think the bank should do the credit valuation and have record in details for borrowing the money to individuals and private firms 
 The best way to avoid financial crisis is to put the money in the most efficient area and then eliminate the zombie companies"
8135,"Maybe 10% for peace of mind, but that can be a reflection of the relative stability in the markets at the moment"
5044,"I guess that the US government's bailout of its financial sector was necessary 
 There can be potential bad consequences of this bailout in term of bad incentives for banks if new rules and new regulations are not implemented 
 Hardly any bad behaviors and decisions from big financial institutions have been sanctioned 
 If the rules remain unchanged, the changes that to see the same scenario happen again is quite high"
6188,"I don't think that holding a large part of portfolio in gold is beneficial for investor and at the same time small part of portfolio won't drastically hedge investors positions in ""black swan' situations 
 Moreover, when the black swan event has happened it's usually too late to save your assets from fast and significant depreciation 
 So it's better to search or create other hedging tools other than gold 
 Thus I think large share of gold leads to lots of lost investment opportunities and little won't change the result 
 I think it's better to buy cheap and falling assets with strong fundamental characteristics and evident opportunity for appreciation and coming back to it's fair value in the future"
1012,"I would  recommend to invest a little portion of the portfolio because we have other alternatives as for example bonds linked to inflation, ETF with short positions and gold market sometimes suffers the intervention of goverments"
2535,"The assumption is that absent future greater cash flows, the  NAV and hence the stock price cannot increase We have seen in the first week that NAV is typically calculated on a 5 years basis + assuming a regular increase of cash flows beyond 
 However no one could assert that this would come true 
 These are just hypthesis, and history can show that on a five years view, analysts are mostly wrong 
 For example in 1999 they highly value Telecom stocks (Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom. 
 ) and two years later these stocks have lost more than 50% in a downturn that was a pure business recession, meaning that the diversification theory even did not work 
 Therefore, on a five years, I think that we should bet that Financial Stocks would rise, rather than stay flat 
 What is the average duration of the bad loans on the banks' balance sheets 
 When we know that figure D, I think that it would be safe to buy Financial Stocks from D - 5 
 And meanwhile a strategy would be to sell puts and / or accumulate on dips 
 So perhaps the recent Brexit big drop of several bank shares is a fantastic opportunity for the value investor"
5616,We use the P/E of the firm XYZ in order to get a fair price of the share ABC. We must consider that the price of the firm XYZ could be wrong
566,"Taking into account the current events in the global market, considering the recent policies of the US government which are leading to a constant depreciation of the USD and considering the instability manifested in the US stock market these past few days, i would probably invest a larger part of my portfolio in gold 
 Whether i wold go for this strategy on the long run or consider doing so at all times, I think it would depend a lot on the other investments in my portfolio 
 Probably by the end of the course i will be able to provide a more knowledgeable answer 
 I will actually keep this question in mind and i will try to answer it again, once i finish the specialization course

5935,"Hi Angel, I'm currently trying to make sure that the necessary terminology is explained when relevant in the videos / quizzes 
 Given that the financial jargon is very extensive, doing a video where all definitions are listed would have been incredibly long and boring for you as learners 
 However, we have provided the link to two online glossaries at the end of week 1 and I hope these can help you in your understanding of the course 
 This being said, do not hesitate to ""flag"" the video were you feel some terminology is unclear to you. That way, we will get a precise idea of where issues persist 
 Thank you and best regards, Jonas"
2652,"The occurrence of black swan,i.e 
 Unconditional events are rare but have nasty outcomes,although 
 The portfolio that investors create should have small part of gold to hedge against such events because these rare occurrences will cause daily tensions among portfolio manager thus loosing opportunity cost from other investments in other markets"
1980,"Time will tell, if the financial institutions who have received this help at the right time will perform more carefully in the future 
 If not, it just delays and amplifies the negative result"
2511,I would go for the second option and have a small part of my portfolio invested in gold which is mainly for the long run since gold doesn't appreciate as much as say equity markets over a longer period of time like 10-15yrs
1618,"It is a successful hero story on the surface 
 The government again plays the big brother role in the market, its large-scale intervention to the market, as a form of bailout and TARP, brought US back from the cliff of self-devastation yet its real economy keeps weak 
 TARP is doing opposite to the market liberalization, it is a bad example to corporate governance,  it destroys the market order, it favors aggressive careless banks, it promotes unhealthy practice whereas cost to risk is being ignored again, and it doesn't benefit retail investors and workers 
 Real economy is lagging behind, poverty is common, there is weak improvement on employment and wage, yet the supply-limited assets keep over-priced as the market is flooding with capital 
 It may throw more stones in killing the market than stabilizing the economy"
243,The government bail out policy was a necessary incentive  to get the economy running
7638,"Νο we dont' have standard time period  DCF. Usually for the profesional a good time period to use dcf model 5-10 years 
 And for investment in the buildings can use the DCF model over twenty years period  
  For the second part of your question it' s not geometric because we have the interest rate (r), and we have time period n 
 For example for 1 an investment is 100/(1+0.1) + 100/(1+0.1)^2 
 I hope to help you    \n"
4988,"Yes - the bailout was necessary 
 Ordinary people had deposits in these banks and if the government had allowed them to fail, these people would have lost their life-savings 
 This would have in  effect resulted in a massive country wide depression, that could have taken a long time (decades) to recover from 
 Obviously more rules should be applied to the banking sector to prevent reckless behaviour"
6110,"Assumption is that: they have the same financial structure, they should be in the same industry and they should in the same lifecycle 
 Valuation should help us to decided whether it is good stock 
 So if the earnings are negative then clearly investment would be negative NPV, ultimately leading to negative decision"
5580,I think this could have consequences and in the future we will see more trouble
809,I would aim to have 10% of golg in my investment portfolio
6591,It is assuming that earnings will be consistent in the future to what they are in the present
6963,"\n\nYes, such cases were when I tried to evaluate the company TESLA 
 The company is unprofitable and profits do not generate"
7207,"Thanks for clarifying Chaturaka 
 Cheers, Ming Hui"
4003,"For a company that just reported a loss, the P/E method breaks down 
 Key assumptions in using comparable could be that the companies apply similar accounting policies, leading to a situation where they have similar cashflows, the companies are at the same stage in their life cycle, meaning that they have the same growth prospects etc. The killer assumption in the latter stage is that the companies will continue to exhibit similar cashflows and growth trajectory going forward 
 This may however not be the case 
 Asset specific risks such as industrial strikes, problems with key suppliers, quirked in quality control, poor stewardship on the part of managers etc may set one company apart from the other 
 In Ghana for example a pharmaceutical company that was hit by a counterfeiting scandal would have thrown valuation out of gear if were used as a comparable for valuing another company simply because it had similar cashflows to the target company"
6824,The assumption is that earnings can't change suddenly
1736,"The assumption is that the assumptions made in the markets reflect the fundamentally correct value of a company, but this is often not the case 
 During the dotcom bubble, for instance, trying to infer an IT company's worth through observing other IT companies on the market would've often led to mistakes"
2459,"Inside the financial markets evolution is so difficult try to determinate the real participation of the gold like a percentage in your portfolio 
 It doesn´t means that you forget this asset, but you can keep a range between 5 % to 20%  of gold in your portfolio 
 It depends of the performance of the gold  market and the international enviroment"
8426,I would choose a rather small part of my portfolio in gold
3328,"The assumption is our target company is comparable to those companies we pick up as contrasts 
 That means, they have to be in the same industry, have similar development stage, asset size, and business structure 
 A negative example where multiple valuation doesn't work well is when we value a private company 
 It's not suitable to use public companies' data as multiples because those companies can vary significantly in size and development stage from our target company 
 For companies with negative earnings, we can apply those multiples that don't involve earnings (like Enterprise Value/Sales) 
    Patrick"
8781,A relatively small part of one's portfolio in gold should be enough to safely insure part of the investments against negative events and losses
8593,"I would include gold as an small part of my portfolio, let's say 4%, as insurance against extreme events in the market 
 This being part of a diversified (asset type, duration, geographic distribution, etc) that will offset as well key import investing risks"
4878,"It was a necessary evil although there is controversy over this move with moral hazard in perspective 
 If the US government did not bail the core financial system out it could have resulted in worser ramifications for the entire modern world 
 However, the US government did let several financial institutions fail such as Lehman and WaMu 
 For banks in the future then, they cannot be fully certain that the government will bail them out. Due to this uncertainty of which banks can get through a potential next financial crisis, risk-taking should be relatively tempered 
 As an addition, to address the actual issue of greed, forgetfulness and circumventing rules, this is something fuelled by poorly disciplined human instinct and would happen as long as there are enough parties that take part in such shady dealings and projects"
2206,"Basically, this is an optimization problem without enough data to actually solve (before it's too late) 
  The optimum is to minimize opportunity cost until one day before black swan and to convert everything into gold 
 Yet, it is not practically achievable 
 Yes, I'd like to keep a small % of my portfolio as gold 
 I still need to work out how (and also capital) 
  I'm thinking of 5% 
  Yet, may be more or may be less"
1370,"The proportion of gold that I'd have in my portfolio would depend on the overall structure of the portfolio it self 
 The overall structure (or risk and return spectrum) would depend on my short and long term goals 
 For an example when I'm young and earning through a profession I'd probably lean towards taking more risk thus the % of gold in my portfolio would be less 
 But as I grow old and my portfolio also increases I'd probably accommodate more gold in to my portfolio"
6039,"As a hedge, it pays to have a small part of your portfolio invested in gold, but due to the high opportunity cost, I would minimise this investment, and seek more rewarding investment vehicles"
523,It depends on the need of the client
6779,"Assumption: the existing comparable firms data is accurate and reflect their true value    Dot Com Tech firm bubble - where the data used for existing firms are highly volatile and unreliable 
 Firms just reported a loss will trigger human irrational behaviour which will skew the true valuation picture of the firm, hence makes the data unreliable"
8249,"Dear Kasper, This is a trick question because the problem in the quiz was about Price/Earnings ratio and you must ignore the debt in your answer 
 However in the lecture, the example was different, because Professor Valta was talking about the EBITDA multiple, and in this case, you must use the debt in your calculation 
 The Classic Definition of EBITDA multiple is: Value/EBITDA = (Market value of equity + Market value of debt) / (Earnings before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation) The example in the lecture was: (Equity USD 102,168 + Debt USD 125) / (EBITDA USD 30,7) = 7,4 which is our Multiple 
 Best regards"
4206,"I was, as professor predicted, confused by the notion that when the yield of a bond INCREASES, its price DECREASES 
 I would assert, after hearing his explanation (I want to sell my bond to buy a car/house, yield has gone up on the new bonds, etc etc) that the scenario should have been described as ""when the yield of a CLASS OF bond goes up. 
 "", because YOUR bond still has the same yield, it is other bonds with same issuer, face amount, etc. whose yield to maturity has changed, thereby competing differently (better or worse, depending) with the instrument you hold 
 Anybody else feel that the wording I refer to leaves something to be desired 
 Just curious, it's a good course, but that accepted terminology seems awkward and difficult"
4321,"The assumption that there is a similar quality of management could prove risky 
 Based on the leadership team's decision making, and how they reinvest and innovate, a company can thrive or fail"
6046,"In my opinion, they dig a hole to fill another hole 
 Sooner or later those assets have to be repaid but are bad assets that worth nothing and they are paying interests over bad assets 
 The government should not bailout any company for their wrong doing and mismanagement without any consequences 
 They saved the economy with a big cost and they can't get out from it 
 The question now is: How are they going to get rid off those asset if nobody wants them 
 It was like buying a broken car for $10000 dlls but it worths nothing 
 They threw money away"
3560,"Ratios assume the market is fairly valuing other companies on the market 
 Any bubble (housing, tech, etc) would demonstrate a situation where comparable companies would have been overvalued as well, skewing the comparison"
6693,Although it as a reward for careless behavior it was necessary to refuel the economy and spur growth during the difficult economic time
1632,"I'd keep gold as a relatively small part of my portfolio 
 In addition I would maintain cash in as many different places as possible to minimize impact of a black swan"
5245,If there is a chance of having an unlikely event in the future we will start investing in gold but on normal basis investment in gold can be around 20% of the total portfolio wealth which will be a normal amount not too much and not too less
1242,"The assumption is that ratios such as price-to-earnings is accurate to value other comparable companies; however, the price-to-earnings ratio varies company to company as earnings are different for each respective company and the price may be inflated based on expected earnings such as in the case of Tesla 
 I have not felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value technology stocks as the multiples tend to be inflated and not representative of current profit and many times have negative earnings 
 For companies that report a loss the multiple based valuation method is not as accurate as the discounted cash flow valuation as the DCF valuation includes the previous years which may have positive earnings"
1972,The bailout has only delayed the occurrence of a major crisis but not cure it's root which was banks careless bank activity

  I would not comfortable using the multiple-based valuation methods when the market is in an abnormal condition: bubble or recession 
 Because there the market is over/under-valued 
 For a company that has just reported a loss: we can use DCF, or price/sales, or price/EBITDA"
1018,"I would rather have a limited amount of gold in my portfolio, just as much to cover my worst losses, in case that happen 
 I feel that by doing so I also manage to make reasonable returns by investing in other markets"
3016,"For an immediate future this would produce desired results 
 However, im more worried about the point when US and other nations with huge national debt will have to pay the debt back 
 It is simply impossible to payback this amount without radical solution 
 This solution is the factor that determines if it was necessary/worth to bailout"

6498,"I would prefer a relatively small percentage of my portfolio in Gold because when black swan events occur and stock markets crash, its usually for a short period of time 
 Markets tend to recover relatively quickly 
 However, i beleive this is a subjective question in that it depends on the risk appetite of the individual investor, their age, goals, personal circumstances etc 
 So if an investor is close to retirement age, they should probably have a greater proportion / percentage of their portfolio in Gold compared to a younger person who would have more time to wait for his portfolio to recover in the event of a black swan /stock market crash or hyper inflation."
8592,"I would rather have a relatively small part of my portfolio invested in god, say about 35%

2808,"Ratios are based on current performance and the present does not necessarily equal the future 
 Projecting future cash flows while takiing into account changes in management or corporate culture can be more accurate"
6035,"Hi Tambe, I enjoyed reading your comments 
 I agree from a theoretical standpoint that letting the banks fail makes most sense to allow the most efficient firms rise in the aftermath 
 The issue is at what cost to the citizens of the country 
 It is the Fed's job to protect the citizens this providing a faster recovery, and the government should put measures in place to avoid similar risky behavior 
 If it were truly a free economy the highs and lows would be even greater and could lead to deeper depressions without proper intervention"
1444,"This has been rather a bad incentives policy IMO, as the banks received the incentives regardless to the bad decisions they had made"
6424,"The multiple-based valuation is not so correct

8505,Would rather have a small part of the portfolio invested in gold
1183,"I am indeed worried 
 I am worried not only about the positive incentives for\nbanks as well as other financial institutions to continue being careless with\ntheir actions and the risks they would take upon themselves as they have done\nuntil now, but I’m just as much worried about the future of the smaller\ninstitutions (those that are not “too big to fail”) 
   That is, due to the lack of fairness of TARP towards the\nsmaller institutions: unlike many of the big financial institutions, that acted\nirresponsibly throughout the years which for the most part led to the financial\ncrisis, many of the smaller institutions acted carefully and conducted their\nbusiness in a responsible manner, just waiting “on the side” for the bigger\nones to fall so they could rightfully and justifiably replace them 
 Now, because\nof TARP, this will never happen 
 This simply twists the rules of free and fair economy\nand business: those whom “behaved” badly got rewarded and those whom acted well\nand wisely got punished

4831,"The bailout was certainly necessary to move forward toward the growth, but it should be introduced along with the reinforcement and sanity mesures toward the banks 
 In order to avoid bad incentives central banks could introduce higher standards for banks balance sheets and require lower risk exposure"

3968,It depends
5010,Smaller portion - maybe enough to survive on
7679,"I would say it has to be 10 to 20 percent of the portfolio 
 However, in 1980 the price was around 2000$ and now less than 1300$ 
  I f to take into account inflation and how much money was printed since 1980, so seems like gold loosing the value in general"
1850,"I believe, It is more of a concern the fact that in all these recessions it is the middle class that takes the biggest hit and this will result in shrinking middle class and the consequences of this incentives is much higher 
 Banks think about one thing and that is maximizing profit and they do whats best to that without looking at its influence or consequences on the whole economy"
1232,"There are several issues with using a single-point-in-time ratio like P/E 
 Like the prompt suggests, it would make a company that had one bad quarter of earnings for e.g 
 One-time charges look very poor, or cyclical companies as well 
 It also doesn't take into account macroeconomic conditions that affect the whole market"
2616,"Indeed, so may argue that the Quantitative easing measures may stimulate unmoral behavior and incentivize banks to undertake excessive risk in order to increase the return without taking the consequences too seriously into consideration 
 There should be certain balance in the Central Banks' intervention but as the tool has proven to bring positive results for the economic performance, it should be used but indeed wisely"
5460,"We assume that the comparable companies in the industry will have a same price for their assets or earnings, despite their differences   2

3462,"Firstly, we have to make sure that the company we are considering is in the same development stage than the comparable firms in order to successfully use multiple-based valuation 
 We are assuming that the present situation of comparable companies (and their multiples) are representative of what is going to happen 
 In case of a crash (""black swan""), any result would prove wrong 
 For a company which just reported a loss, it would be necessary to understand why they had a loss (development stage, exceptional circumstances, etc.), and it would not be reasonable to use multiple-based valuation considering the multiples of companies which are having positive earnings"
3287,"As evidenced by the faster turnaround of the US economy compared to the Eurozone, such policies were effective

314,"Using multiple based valuation is simpler and intuitively appealing 
 DCF is depended on too many assumptions for the forecast of FCF.

 Extreme events are rare, and I would be better off riding them out rather than tying up assets to hedge against something that may never happen 
 For example, I lost a good chunk out of my retirement account during the crash of 2007/2008, but left it alone and had it back up to pre-crash levels within a year or so

 If we talk about usual portfolio's, which  controls by  3rd party sides, I'm in doubt that usual investor should hold significant part of assets in gold

9073,Yes DCF valuation method is not an easy task!
492,"I would rather / have a modest part invested in gold in order to hedge against any mentioned events, but not a significant part to avoid the opportunity costs / diminished overall returns 
 As an intermediate solution one could invest in gold producers whose price will rise with rising gold price, but also generate returns in the absence of bear markets 
 Would be keen to know whether this is seen as a wise investment decision"
4795,"I think the bailout was necessary and the possible negativ effects (""bad incentives"") should be avoided with further strict regulations"

 I wouldn't use P/E ratio during financial crises nor in the case of companies reporting losses"

7546,"The issue has no solution, as both answer are correct (we can apply the one stone-two birds principle here too): moral hazard exists, and banks were to big to fail 
 But at least the US had Lehman 
 So, lets say that 10 institutions were bailed out in the US 
 And one failed 
 That makes a probability of a bit less than 10% that you are not rescued and so bank managers may (hopefully) take care 
 I think Lehman's fall may have its benefits and so it should be presented"
959,Is not that necessary
1531,"In case of DCF we tent to take simpler financial forecasts and numbers, but in case of MBV we tent to take simpler human factor and details 
 First of all, companies that looks the same and have more-less similar structure, can have different trends and different management 
 Like, company A is constantly growing during last 10 years, they have a stable high-level management team and want to introduce to market new product, and company B is falling down during last 5 years, they change management team 3 months ago, but still the capital and brand is quite power to have the same P/E 
 Or, for example, one of companies with the same P/E finally has an agreement with Chinese government and from the next year will work on this market, and the second company - does not have such 
 So, for now they both looks the same, but opportunities to growth and significantly increase earnings has only first 
 EBITDA rate is also not the best, because EBITDA is the earnings before, for example, amortization, and one of companies has new buildings and this costs is low for them, and other company, with the same EBITDA has 39-years old building of main factory and amortization for them will be more bigger, because of law restrictions to 40-years old buildings, for example 
 Or, one of companies save their money on a deposit of one bank, and other - in Apple and Alphabet shares and interest rate for both of them will be different 
 So, finally, in my opinion, multiples-based valuation method does not touch a lot of details and simplify such things like a management factor, assets of company, etc"

 However, the knowledge that if again after bad choices of investment things turn bad and the government will be there to support them, this will most certainly influence the way the banks are making investment plans 
 In my opinion, the government should work as a regulator of banks' extend of power and oversee all new banking tools released"

 The implication is that future cash flows will be significantly effected and these companies may not be comparable due to going concern issues"

 If the portfolio contains\nmainly EM assets, then more importance should be given to gold as more black\nswans or dangerous events would be more likely to be expected 
 Less importance\nshould be given if only invested in DMs. Furthermore, if you are trying to hedge against gold, other\ninvestments such as TIPS are possible 
 I think that these would also overcome\nthe opportunity cost associated with old as you would earn a return which is\nnot eroded by inflation

 For the larger good of the economy and people's well being, getting things moving was critical to not have another great depression 
 But, for as much effort the government put into bailing the banks, they didn't much done in terms of prosecuting the people involved or setting stronger standards to avoid predatory lending

 By doing so, the government applies a soft measure to banks, accepting their failures as the financial institutions were not very meticulous with their and third parties's wealth 
 At the same time, the government always applies a hard measure to individuals and SMEs 
 In the end all seems that it is a legal and not serious way to collect money from the society and transfer it to the big financial institutions which are in a steady coalition with big corporations 
 In conclusion, I do not believe that the governments' bailout around the world is necessary for the well-being of the economy, instead it is a faster way to grow the wealth of the financial institutions and, indirectly, the corporations"

  I strongly believe that the Achilles' heel of this method is finding the right firm 
 In my opinion, it is very difficult to identify a firm which has the same features (industry, operating risk and stage development) of the firm in consideration 
 In addition, comparable companies must have prices that correctly reflect their value 
 We have already seen that this statement is not always true

 I wouldn't feel comfortable using the multiple-based valuation in times of crisis, or even when inovations bring an alarming growth to a company, these are times of instability and the companies might be over/undervaluated 
 The fact that a company reported a loss alone doesn't invalidate the comparison, as it could be due to a factor that affects an entire acting field in the economy, so the reasons why it reported a loss should be studied before using it to compare to other companies"

 This could be due to any of the following factors:   One invested more into hydro energy than the other, and the previous year had very low rainfall   Both invested the same in solar energy, but one was situated in a cloudier region and hence had less returns for the same cash input    One invested more capital in sales marketing than the other   One of the companies managed to source coal for a lower price   Especially in Information Technology, one might have gained a competitive advantage through invention (refer Google vs Yahoo, Lycos, Altavista) By applying ratios, we are assuming that    What affects one company will affect the other in the exact same way (supply / sale prices, environmental factors, etc.)   The skill of management is the same, and will remain constant   Competition does not exist (i.e 
 A customer growth of one will not result in decline for the other)   Every $ of investment will result in returns whichever of the two companies you invest with   Where two companies sell the same commodity (i.e 
 Their products are exactly the same and differ only in marketing and price), I would be happier to apply multiples methods than in industries where many factors could affect the outcome 
 In the scenario where a company has just posted a loss, I would compare it to other companies in the same industry 
 If others have suffered similar losses, the ratio methods hold true 
 Where only one files a loss, I would look for similarities - is the company I'm trying to evaluate closer (with regards to customer demographics, product, circumstances, etc.) to the one that posted a loss, or to the ones that posted a profit"

 If the ratios are not correct then our valuation of comparable companies could be very incorrect as well 
 Anytime the P/E ratios or other ratios are extremely high such as the dot com bubble or before the 1929 crash or before the subprime crisis is a red flag as to when it is not advisable to use the ratios on the market to value companies 
 When a company reports a loss the P/E ratio goes negative, however as the earnings approach zero the ratio approaches infinity which makes no sense and why the P/E ratio should be used in conjunction with other valuation methods"

 With this in mind, we would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods in times like early 2008 
 The multiple based approach could also be difficult to be used for companies that just temporarily reported a loss as b/c that negative earning might not be a true reflection of the company's more medium to long-term performance"

 So in the case of the financial crisis of 2008 TARP with its ultimate use to inject capital into banks was the absolute right thing to do in my view 
 The fact that it actually made money for the taxpayer while helping to avoid a second Great Depression is evidence of that"

 Example if we need to cover a period of say one to two year  (post a black Swan event) then the Gold investment should be able to have us carry over this period 
 Simplistically put, from a pure income perspective (like a retiree) I would have needs for over 25 years of sustenance

 In an equity stock market the higher weight is given to the bigger company and as such smaller firms can get lost in the mix , ie the earnings of the company may seem a lot lesser than the equity stock market thereby making the ratio of the companies earnings to the equity market (P/E ratio) higher leading to higher than fair valuation of the company

6515,"There are several problems with gold as an investment:   Gold goes not have an internal rate of return as such so I do not consider it to be an investment 
 There are transaction and storage costs associated with owning gold 
 These costs work against the assets returns to the investor 
 Historically, gold has not kept pace with the American equity markets 
 In fact the US stock market has outperformed gold by orders of magnitude over the last two hundred years 
 For these reasons, I only own enough gold to carry me through a short period of market turbulence 
 I accomplish this by owning an ETF that invests in gold"
5272,"A big concern I have is the impact of low interest rates created by central banks on equities and value of fixed income holdings 
 Cheap money may fuel economic growth but sustained cheap money can have series consequences on the willingness of investors to put their money to work - given the looming uncertainty about interest rates and their effect on portfolios, real or financial 
 I would be short on fixed income securities if I suspect interest rates are going to rise 
 Perhaps I would the same for equities depending on what I believe the P/E should be 
 This is a time for hedging up 
 Sure, if bank returns are low because of interest rates, investors including banks have to chase yield or higher returns 
 This puts them at great risk 
 Operationally, banks have to be creative in identifying new revenues streams to help offset low interest earning on loans for example 
 Take the case of Wells Fargo in its efforts to boost earning being rather reckless in churning, cross selling and other devices to extract revenues and fees from clients 
 If banks are reluctant to lend more liberally, other financial institutions step their place without the degree of oversight and scrutiny of bank regulators - putting more cash and hard assets at risk"
7456,"On Sept 
 8, 2008, the U.S 
 Treasury seized control of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and pledged a $200 billion cash injection to help the companies cope with mortgage default losses 
 About a week later the government bailed out American International Group Inc., or AIG, with $85 billion 
 The Fed refused to save Lehman Brothers and the company was forced to file for bankruptcy 
 Some of the largest financial institutions were on the verge of collapse as the mortgage market melted down 
 As the crisis hit the global market, the credit freeze spread 
 The Treasury and the Federal Reserve began working on a $700 billion bailout plan 
 The US President signed the bailout plan into law Oct. 3 
 Weeks later, on Oct. 29, the Fed cut the key interest rate to 1% 
    What was expected   The government claimed the bailout was necessary to provide stability in the economy and prevent disruption in the financial system 
 The interest rate cut aimed to revive the economy, help free up credit and make loans cheaper to consumers and businesses 
 What happened   The financial markets remained in turmoil for several months 
 Credit remains tight to this day, although it loosened significantly compared to when lending nearly came to a halt during the collapse period 
 Mortgage rates fell significantly after the interest rate cut and amid expectations that the Fed would start buying mortgage-backed securities"

5537,"It has of course some effects on banks as 'incentives'

 Where is the equilibrium point 
 In my perspective (conservative) the portfolio of all assets should follow the rule, 50-30-20 in all levels (inside the asset too) 
  The first number is the percentage of low to no risk investments, the second of medium risk and the third of highr risk investments 
 Inside the asset same rule is applied, only that the low-medium-high is not exactly the risk, but the return/risk ratio 
 SO, for me gold lies in the initial 50% of the low risk investments assets, and inside this is the 50% of the total investment in these asset classes 
 In conclusion gold should represent the 25% of the total investment portfolio

 Also, if the firm has reported a ""one-off"" increase or decrease in profit, it may be necessary to adjust the profit figure when using the multiples approach 
 A multiple-based valuation approach can also be inappropriate if there are no comparable quoted companies 
 In this situation, it may be difficult to find a multiple to apply to the company's profit 
 A multiple based approach may also be inappropriate where the company is growing significantly faster or slower than the comparable quoted companies 
 I feel that an approach based on a multiple of earnings is likely to be inappropriate where a company is sacrificing profitability in order to rapidly grow its sales 
 An example at the current time might be Amazon"

5545,"The biggest assumption seems to be that the ratio is always reflective of fair value 
 A comparable company can still have a skewed P/E ratio if the analysis done for that particular company was wrong to begin with 
 And thus, garbage in garbage out. We base our comparison on a false ratio 
 I would seldom use multiple based valuation methods because so many other intangible (and therefore impossible to put a ratio on) factors such as management competency, consumer brand strength etc make a company virtually unique in terms of strength/weakness 
 When a company reported a loss in the most recent annual report, it is not the be-all indicator 
 The earnings might have been corroded by factors beyond their control, but with good management (and sometimes accounting magic), the company might maintain their ratios by cutting expenses and allowances 
 A company with negative earnings might have increased efficiency, and therefore pave the way for growth in the future, as long as they retain their competitive advantages 
 Therefore, i believe it is not a strong indicator for comparing/not comparing value if taken by itself"

4977,"That assumption is that \nfirm is expected to be in high growth for the next n years and stable growth\nthereafter 
 A valuation multiple is simply an expression of market value of an asset relative to a key statistic that is assumed to relate to that value 
 You would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies when that statistic – whether earnings, cash flow or some other measure – does not bear a logical relationship to the market value observed, when it is not seen as the driver of that market value 
 A multiple is a distillation of a great deal of information into a single number or series of numbers 
 By combining many value drivers into a point estimate, multiples may make it difficult to disaggregate the effect of different drivers, such as growth, on value 
 The danger is that this encourages simplistic – and possibly erroneous – interpretation 
 A multiple represents a snapshot of where a firm is at a point in time, but fails to capture the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of business and competition 
 Multiples are primarily used to make comparisons of relative value 
 But comparing multiples is an exacting art form, because there are so many reasons that multiples can differ, not all of which relate to true differences in value 
 For example, different accounting policies can result in diverging multiples for otherwise identical operating businesses 
 The use of multiples only reveals patterns in relative values, not absolute values such as those obtained from discounted cash flow valuations 
 If the peer group as a whole is incorrectly valued (such as may happen during a stock market ""bubble"") then the resulting multiples will also be misvalued 
 Multiples are based on historic data or near-term forecasts 
 Valuations based on multiples will therefore fail to capture differences in projected performance over the longer term, and will have difficulty correctly valuing cyclical industries unless somewhat subjective normalization adjustments are made 
 Companies with losses (negative earnings) or no profit have an undefined P/E ratio (usually shown as ""not applicable"" or ""N/A""); sometimes, however, a negative P/E ratio may be shown 
 There are multiple versions of the P/E ratio, depending on whether earnings are projected or realized, and the type of earnings

  My questions are:   How do we calculate WACC 
 In this course, WACC is given to us 
 How do we calculate r (discounted rate) 
  I understand that its sometimes taken from the central bank's interest rate, but how does that work when calculating the rate for 3-4 years in advance 
 Thank You! Daniel"
14,"It's better to answer this depending on the current state of the market 
 If it's an emerging market, as we have seen, it tends to be riskier, so it's better to have a larger portion for gold 
 If it's a stable market, we can safely go for more of equities and bonds rather than gold"

5466,"The assumption is that comparable companies are correctly valued 
 For instance, right before the dotcom bubble, comparable companies would have all had extremely high P/E ratios that did not accurately reflect the value of the firm"
8110,"The multiple method is considered overly simplistic and, as the DCF analysis,  it makes several assumption too : 1) we are assuming that the companies we chose to compare are similar enough/ we are ignoring all the distinctive features that make a brand unique (growh prospect, patents, history of the brand. 
 ) 2) we are assuming that the peer we picked for comparison purposes is not undervalued/overvalued itself (far from its fair value)  
  If stock market enters in a heyday period, the value of the stocks is likely to be overestimated (e.g 
 _domain_  bubble, where the H-Tec companies' shares were trading well above fair value) 3)negative earnings make ratios such as P/E inapplicable"

 If a part is too small - it won't help you too much"
367,"The first issue that comes to mind when using multiple-based valuation is that it uses the share price (the P in P/E) to determine value 
 However, it is possible that the share (or even sector or the whole market) could be overvalued 
 Therefore, if you have to be 100% invested then the multiple-based valuation approach is useful as it gives you relative values - but not absolute 
 This generally happens during equity ""bubbles"" and the  _domain_  bubble comes to mind as a good example"

952,"Since banks play a crucial role in the economy, it is only necessary for the government to bail these ailing banks back into recovery 
 And because banks have a vital role to play, they should be treated differently from the rest of the industries (i.e automotive and manufacturing) 
   However, bailouts should not be used as an easy way out to rescue banks but as a last resort to bring balance in the financial ecosystem 
 Along with the bailouts should also be harsher punishment for erring and abusive banks"

899,"Multiples based valuations use data which can be manipulated by directors when presenting their accounts, which would distort the true picture of the company 
 We also assume that the companies have similar risk, both operational risk and financial risk and that companies are liquid and solvent in order to continue to operate in the foreseeable future 
 Taking  Lehman Brothers for example, they could have very well been used by other major banks as a comparator however, they quickly went belly up when the housing crisis hit when they had just previously been believed to be a sound bank 
 Any comparisons at this point would have been void 
 Enron is another example where the financial statements of the company were sound, but this was because of manipulation on the part of directors as well as accounting firms"

6404,"I think I need to study a lot more before I could answer this for sure, but at this point, I see gold as a hedge as opposed to an investment 
 That said, it does have utility during inflationary periods and could possibly be somewhat of an investment then, though I'm not sure how that correlates with equity markets"

1251,"The assumption most likely relates to (1) the risks faced by the companies being compared and (2) whether the company is fairly valued by the market 
 I would be wary of using this method in bubbles like the 90's tech book, when almost every company was overvalued by the market 
 Moreover, negative earnings would result in negative P/E ratios, which would not be a good indicator of the company's true value"

2970,"Because every company is different to that of another 
 For the multiple-based valuation method which bases ""on the value of comparable firms that we observe on the market"" 
  One could compare the price ratios of one company to another but there would be limitations on applying such ratios over other companies as they are different 
 We would assume that such ratios of comparable companies would be compatible but not correct 
 And it would be worse if we were to apply these ratios to companies that reported a loss or that reported a negative earnings 
 This method could be useful in applying to comparable companies in a similar industry"

5913,"The relative portion of Gold in portfolio essentially depends on the particular investor, his risk appetite 
 In a way Gold is an insurance investment that protects in the unlikely events and as it has been described in the lecture, the annualized return on Gold is just 9%, it is not recommended to invest more than 10-15% of portfolio in insurance investment"
6282,"I would look at a number of factors before making this decision 
 A 
 The risk appetite of the investor 
 This would determine if one should invest in safe stuff like gold or traditional assets like bonds, FDs etc. b 
 The other aspect is also the perception of seeing something in hand as physical gold would provide vs a piece of paper 
 Being in India this is still a big factor"

2795,Using multiple-based valuation method will overestimate the fair price when the entire market is in a bubble
2940,"I would put just a small amount into gold 
 I think investing in the right stocks will give far higher returns 
 With a decent sized portfolio, one could live off the returns from stocks, but I'm doubt this is feasible with gold 
 That being said, I would buy some gold in case an apocalyptic event happens 
 All jokes aside, if the system were to collapse, fiat money would be worthless, and barter would become the foundation of the new economy"

4681,"Jonathan bear in mind that when banks hold more reserves, then they can lend more (in accordance with the leverage levels allowed by agreements), creating more money in circulation, leading to expansion, this is what I believe is meant by ""printing money"" 
  Is very interesting your post about Velocity the V that at the end maybe has been shown to be of high importance, while the public trust in the currency and the stability remains, there is no reason to clash with an inflationary panic 
 But any way it can be wise to be somewhat wary about the delayed (and magnified) impact of the expansionist money periods"
5784,"A very important assumption that we make by using rations that could imply on mistakes is about the management of companies 
 They could have completely different policies, what could implicate directly on their earnings 
 It is also important to observe the level of international business of the companies, because, not only, their own management policies can affect its results, but also countries policies where they have business or even natural disasters can affect one company and not other, so history facts can implicate on different ratios 
 Negative earnings should be seen closely to identify if it was a single bad result of one company, that, in this case, should be discarded form the analysis, or if the bad result apply to the particular market at this particular time 
 In the second case, DCF valuation could be a more assertive method"
583,"Of course, the bail out is very necessary to lift US from recession 
 On the other hand, theoretically, this act does give incentives for some big banks to be less concerned about with risk, because they are too big to fall

 More regulations are in place, mostly importantly raising minimum reserves "

5814,"I would rather hold up to 10% of my assets in gold during a bull market, but if there were signs of a bear market, then change the gold amount 30-50% of my assets

3390,"The company we are comparing has to be in the same industry in order to have similar profitability expressed in similar ROA and ROE, has to be in the same life cycle and growth stage, and firms of the same industry and of the same growth stage must have a similar capital financing structure, i.e 
 Similar debt to equity and financial leverage ratios 
 When firms have different dividend payout ratios and different dividend yield policies 
 P/E= (DIV/EPS)/(DIV/P) 
  If two firms of the same industry and in the same lyfe cycle stage have different dividend policies due to the volatility of earnings, the use of multiples to valuate comparable firms may be not precise 
 When a firm is having losses owing to external/systemic and/or internal(specific factor the P/E do not apply 
 For example TSLA is still reporting a negative net profit and then do not have a reported PER. Further, many companies related to commodities like oil firms are subject to the price risk of the commodity, and at the moment are having some financial distress that makes PER not applicable even if thet are still very valuable companies"

4227,"Hi, almost graduating Math major here"
2526,"In my opinion multiple-based valuation method can show not very correct results because of the difference between companies 
 They have different background, different workers and management, different technologies and geographic position, etc. We can't also always rely on this method when company reports a loss 
 We need to investigate the causes of this loss 
 What if money were spent on a serious investment project, that will bring benefit within next few years, i.e 
 Upgrading facilities 
 Or they were spent for absorbing a competitive company and now firm we are looking at will become a monopolist.\n"
1612,"Bailout depends, considering the level towards degree of recovery and maturity of the economy in the hands of the government 
 In a nutshell, bailout is necessary"
3761,"In my opinion, it's pretty hard to find identically comparable companies 
 Even though all conditions can look like the same in a fact they could differentiate dramatically 
 For example, different accounting policies inside of the company can affect final multiples 
 Also, a management team can play a different game and hide many conditions which are not known for external players 
 I would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies in a time of ""bubbles"" 
  For instance, currently, we are having a boom with a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum 
 Many people are buying Bitcoin just because the price of it is growing rapidly, without understanding a single line of code from the blockchain technology 
 In this way, we can't rely on the date which we have out there because it's affected by speculation 
 About a company which just reported a loss, first of all, we need to analyze why it's happened 
 Maybe a company got into loss situation due to a bad management, but a business itself has perspectives 
 Thus it makes sense to buy some stocks while it has a lower price 
 On the other hand, likely company which has negative earnings isn't supposed to be attractive for investors"

 Notwithstanding this, the bailout is a necessary evil, without with there will be lack of funds to investment in the real economy as the banks will have to many non-performing loans"

5179,My opinion bailout was needed in line with more severe requirements for the future limitations to loans granting
801,"I believe in both of these points of view: First it is the government's role to rescue a nation from its immediate collapse, thus I believe that TARP program was necessary but not sufficient to avoid the situation the country experienced in the 1930's 
 Where the government dropped the ball was to give the bankers complete freedom to do whatever they wanted with the 3.5 Trillion USD of the taxpayers money 
 This could have been avoided if a society had a control signal to modulate corruption between the politicians and the bankers 
 This is a signal similar to what the central banks use to modulate the economy, by controlling interest rates 
 This signal is called educating the masses of the white collar corruption that exists in practically all nations of the world 
 Ultimately a sound economic functioning of a society is the responsibility of its own citizens, thus a society should create adequate infrastructure, such that maximum transparency is created at all levels of the government 
 Once the people of a country realise that it is the very rich and the high powered government servants are the root cause of this economic meltdown, where millions of its citizens will suffer its bad consequences, then society as a whole will realise that in order to have a sustainable system in which even the crooked amongst us also do have a need to survive, then it becomes mandatory to mitigate corruption and not to exceed it beyond a certain threshold level for all of its citizens to live in moderate stability and safety of its societal structural systems, i.e 
 Political, legal, educational, commercial, etc. This is ultimately a problem of squarely looking at our own human nature, which at a fundamental level does not believe that honesty and honor has any place in today's economic market place, once people realise this flaw and take acceptable actions to change the values of a society, by raising our children not only think of themselves but also our neighbors well fare, till then even the courts will NOT be able to solve this problem, as we are witnessing in USA today

6705,"A key assumption is that the companies you compare to are themselves at fair value 
 Companies in the same sector may as a group be over- or undervalued e.g 
 Tech bubble where technology and telecoms firms became over valued 
 Using this approach, you would have likely calculated that a particular tech firm was approximately fair value, when in fact the sector as a whole was massively over valued 
 When there is a large amount of speculation in a particular sector about future growth, the results of this method should therefore be taken with caution 
 \nUsing negative earnings in this method gives a negative fair value, which is illogical given a firm has limited liabilities, thus can not loose an investor more than what they invest, making the minimum firm value zero 
 \n\n This method also assumes that revenues or EBITDA are representative of the overall performance of the business 
 There may be large one-off large costs (e.g 
 Restructuring, fines) or one-off sources of revenues (e.g 
 Sale of a division of the firm) which affect headline profits while underlying profits which is more representative of long-term outlook give a different picture of relative performance compared to its peers 
 An unexpected change in macroeconomic conditions (e.g 
 Sudden recession) will also affect fair value, not taken into account when looking at past profits"

 If these unconventional incentives have helped the economies to recover faster then this is a good thing b 
 In terms of banks bad incentives I believe this would only be a problem if banks ""coordinate"" and fail all at the same time 
 If only certain banks pursue more relaxed lending policies and their bankruptcy would not impact the economy then there is no reason for the Central Bank to intervene and bail them out. Additionally, competitor banks could pursue a strategy of waiting for other banks to fail (provided these continue to sell sub-prime financial products) in order gain additional market share

2837,"On one hand, it seems that it was a necessary measure to allow the US economy to recover from the crisis and also to prevent the formation of a recession 
 The example of Japan in the 90s shows that the bursting of a speculative bubble can compromise balance sheets of banks to such an extent that no lowered interest rate monetary policy is able to prevent the credit crunch and massive economic stagnation that ensues 
 On the other hand, as suggested by Niall Ferguson in his ""The great degeneration"" the lack of criminal/civil accountability of the people (managers) responsible for creating such a crisis is the real bad incentive for banks, as they profited millions during the bubble and did not have to suffer the consequences of their irresponsible management decisions (which were suffered by society as whole on their behalf)"

 Although, holding 'some' gold is better than holding no gold whatsoever as an insurance policy 
 Following the Dodd-Frank Act, I would have a strong belief that markets are more regulated and controlled 
 As a result, I would then invest more heavily in the traditional assets, equities and fixed income, indeed with the conviction that my wealth will rise over the long-run"
2565,"I think main assumption is that thr ratio remains the same for different companies 
 Although it seems reasonable ratios for different companies can be very different from average 
 It's also assumed that other companies are fairly priced which might not be the case 
 As multiplied negative values would still remain negative this method probably has to be amended 
 E/g 
 Using moving average for certain amount of periods 
 This valuation method also doesn't distinguish a nature of loss 
 It's not the same if, for example, there were loss due do buying new equipment or due to management spent all the money on increasing salaries for themselves"

8223,"There are a few limitations that we should be aware of 
 Firstly, the assumption that the market has valued the business correctly 
 We saw this play out in the dot-com bubble, where P/E was 60 versus an industry average of 90, is a painful mistake 
 Secondly, all valuation metrics are based on past performance, and does not account for growth 
 Lastly (but not least), comparable valuation is no assurance that the ""cheaper"" company will outperform its peer"
4291,"The assumption we have to make is that companies trade in the market at their fair value, which Mr

 Indeed, their quotations may be influenced by other factors, such as what he calls ""alternative investment opportunities"" 
  In addition, comparable companies may face different economic situations (such as negative earnings), which would greatly affect the P/E ratio 
 Investors should therefore be careful, even when comparing quite similar companies"

4679,"It was a bad incentive because: actions were not taken by the Federal reserve and the SEC  to properly stem the careless practices that led to the crises in the first place before bailing out the banks 
 Some of the practices include but is not limited to:  1)placing highly leveraged bets against the asset backed securities (mortgage backed Securities) they issued to uniformed investors just to make quick profit,  2) lack of control of the interest rates ( floating rates) on the mortgages given to individuals that barely had the resources to pay back the loans, so when the rates increased they defaulted on their repayments on their mortgages  the asset backed securities became worthless,  3) the bankers kept on marketing the already worthless securities to unsuspecting investors on the secondary market coupled with the fact that the rating agencies did not downgrade the ratings of those securities 
 Therefore the Federal Reserve used tax payers money to bail out banks that intentionally carried out careless practices that can be repeated in the future 
 The Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies should instead have increased regulation and monitoring of the banks before bailing them out to prevent a repeat of such carelessness on the part of the banks then bail them out to boost the economy"

5685,"When used, we assume that two competitive businesses are structured the same, with closely comparable products, customers, margins, accounting practices, etc.   In history, I would be uncomfortable using multiple based valuation methods when the market of the company(ies) were new with high variability in many factors influencing their ratios, prior to GAAP, and during highly volatile market conditions

2591,"Hi Dave, As you may have noticed, the numerator of the formula you provided is the Terminal Value as presented by Philip 
 The denominator in the formula you provided discounts this Terminal Value back to its value today 
 So basically, Philip's formula gave you the (value of the) Terminal Value at the end of the of the explicit forecasting horizon (i.e 
 In the future) while the formula here gives you the (value of the) Terminal Value today 
 This is why in Philip's example of firm valuation, the Terminal Value (equal to 1742 in 2020) has to be discounted along with the free cash flow forecast in 2020 in order to get its value today 
 To summarize, the formula you provided here gives the present value of the Terminal Value 
 I hope this helps

8091,"Hi, I think Prof 
 Girardin is not quite accurate when he states in lecture 4.1.1 that  the primary goal of the Reserve Bank of Australia is ""Maintaining the integrity and value of the currency"" 
   From the RBA website; ""Its (the RBA's) duty is to contribute to the stability of the currency, full employment, and the economic prosperity and welfare of the Australian people 
 It does this by setting the cash rate to meet an agreed medium-term inflation target, working to maintain a strong financial system and efficient payments system, and issuing the nation's banknotes.""  The RBA's inflation target is between 2-3% and we have just had cash rates drop to 1.75% as inflation has dropped below 2%

 In this context, the central banks transformed from heroes into villains, effectively diverting tax money paid by regular people and giving them freely to banks and corporations which effectively do not pay any taxes (because they have an army of lobbyists, lawyers and safe haven places to help them avoid them) 
  The consequences are in a timely order: 1) increased income inequality leading to 2)  global anger and discontent of large populations leading to 3) unusual political decisions aimed to ""correct"" the system leading to 4) political and social instability leading to 5) war.

 Gold can be traded two ways; buy a gold etf (i.e GLD) or buy physical gold 
 The GLD offers much more liquidity and fast return of cash to your portfolio, with little commission cost 
 Owning physical gold has a higher premium ($50 usd over spot price in some case) and it is harder to convert to cash 
 If the  global market was to crash, your physical gold will be worth more than the GLD etf because that runs with the index and a selloff will drag down the GLD eft, and lets not forget the financial institutions that backs those ETF. I don't think we will see such a global crisis which will make holding physical gold or ETF more valuable than owning stocks 
 That is whyI limit it between 5-10%, I rather BUY the GLD and trade options to protect my exposure"
3833,"The major assumption of a multiples valuation is that the multiple is from a comparable company 
 We can try to find the closest company possible, yet not all companies are the same 
 If I were to valuate a new chinese phone maker by using a multiple from Apple; while they both produce phones and may have similar debt levels, Apple also produces a wider range of products and services and is at a different stage of firm development 
 Multiples method relies too heavily on another companies performance versus a DCF valuation, that takes into account expected future revenue and costs, the key drivers of a specific companies performance 
 I would prefer DCF method in the case of startups that are producing disruptive and not as easily comparable technologies, and also may have negative earnings in their early years"
6965,"Banks are the cornerstone of our society 
 We cannot function without them which unfortunately encourages supports a risky behaviour and TARP is definitively proof of that 
 I support the idea that investment banks should be kept separate and isolated from traditional bricks and mortars counterparts

7965,"Good points Abelardo 
 On Gold, I use it as long term insurance (LTI) 
  not as an investment 
 Both methods need a valuation Monetarily, Gold @ $1,181/oz and global supply at ~5.9 Billion oz 
 We have ~$7Trillion in gold 
 Well, if the  Global M1 money supply is $20Trillion & M2 is $48Trillion 
  The price of gold needs to increase 10X.  Possibility-perhaps 
 As we know from Accounting,  cash assets +  non-cash assets =liabilities +owners equity 
 So, increase one side and the other side must also go up 
 Any takers for either side 
 Let's use F&C's (Floors & Ceilings) 
  Take an exchange traded fund (ETF) like GLD and tract it for the highs (Ceilings) & lows (Floors) 
   As LTI.  one can   use F&C's over a long period of time (historical of course) and buy GLD near the low. Later when the price reaches an amount you are comfortable with (insurance wise) 
  sell it and put in in a safe place until you need it 
 As an investment, similar process 
 But here one needs to determine their Minimum acceptable Rate Of Return (MARR) + use F&C's to follow a trend that produces your MARR 
 This may be short or long term 
 Keep in mind that long term may be a very long time 
 So choose wisely 
 Now, if all you want is to get a market return 
 Then, why are you looking at GLD? just use SPY. This is an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 (an indicator of the Market) 
  They are both volatile but the SPY is more stable 
 Depending on your time horizon 
 One may be more advantageous than the other 
 Historical F&C's 1) 
  Buy  GLD in 2010  @ $100. Sell in 2012 @ $175 for a 32% CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) 
   2) 
   Buy  GLD in 2010  @ $100. Sell in Feb 2016 @ $114 for a 2% CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) 
  3) 
  Buy  GLD in Jan 2016 @ $105.  In Feb 2016 it is $114. This is 8.57%  Bottom line

If for instance, the TARP program would had been addressed the house owners in order to pay back their loans, the banks balance sheets would have end up on a similar situation, with the advantage that the wealth would had been better distributed 
 That could had well help all the sectors / workers rather than only estimulating financial companies"

6827,"I think an assumption that we could possibly make is that the market has priced the company correctly 
 An investor might assume that because it has an high P/E ratio that it is over priced or that because it has a low P/E ratio that the market doesn't see the company as potentially having strong earnings in upcoming quarters 
 I don't feel that just because a company that reports negative earnings should be sold or ignored 
 One quarter doesn't spell doom for a company or the stock 
 Which is why it can be foolish to pick a stock based on simple valuation methodologies because they only give a snap shot into the true value of a company 
 Using DCF valuation hopefully gives us a better idea of the fair value"
4651,"Perhaps, the assumption is that the company is not artificially effect the price and earning of the stock using accounting and management tools 
 P/E also doesn't reflect data about growth ratio and debt, which might be crucial to know about before investing in the company 
 Regarding to historical facts, a sudden crush down of Blackberry as a reaction of high popularity of new generation phones by Samsung and Apple (cliche), is an example of how multiple-based valuation might not reflect the actual situation on the market 
 Overvalued Nokia stocks might be from the same basket 
 A loss might be different: a short and long term 
 Can be caused of different reasons, which are easy to fix or not. As far as I know, it is quite common for some industries (hi-tech, pharmacy) to have a loss, but still attract investment, since the benefit of the successful outcome might overweight the risk"
5621,"When we use multiples to value the company we make assumptions about: - company’s capital structure  - tax rate - cost of capital - growth rates - similarities of their business models - riskiness if the business  It might not be the best way to use multiples to value a company when: - we are not sure if we properly understand and are able to evaluate the assumptions mentioned above - meaning that we cannot be sure if the companies we use as valuation benchmarks are really comparable  - the market overall is overvalued or undervalued - the valuations are unreasonably high or low and companies market value do not correctly reflect their fair value  - the company we value is going through the specific period of it’s development (e.g 
 High marketing costs compared to its peers or incurred one of loss which distorts its earnings) making its metrics not suitable for using multiples valuation method  If a company just reported a loss it’s bottom line can’t be used for multiples valuation 
 We may try to use other metrics, such as:  sales, book value, asset value, EBITDA, operating metrics (e.g 
 Output or reserves for mining companies) or use forecasts for next year or two or use other valuation methods like DCF to determine the value of the company"

 Also, that all the market challenges and advantages for them are the same 
 Times in history when the overall market experienced slump and in the times of war or natural calamities that impacted a geographical region could maybe serve as an example of times when multiple based valuation did not serve well 
 In such situations, earnings of comparable companies could widely fluctuate 
 If a company just reported negative earnings, it's stock most likely will go down in value, but the degree of the slump in value depends on the particular company's past history, assets, leadership, reason of the slump and market perception 
 Some companies rebound back quicker than others"

 As touched upon by the UBS guest lecturer, inequality has risen in each of these geographical areas 
 I don't think it is any surprise that there has been a vicious lurch to the right as a result; US is suffering from a nationalism unseen there in over 150 years; English nationalism reached its nadir with the ill thought out vote to leave the European Union; elections in Greece, Germany, Austria and France have all seen increased support for fascist parties 
 The US central bank has seen more success that it's European counterparts 
 It is inconceivable that UK and European governments are so weak that they could not have imposed restrictions upon businesses, forcing them to lend where appropriate 
 Quantitive Easing saw eye watering amounts of money transferred to banks, to increase their liquidity, thus allowing them to lend more freely 
 However they did not. This policy turned out to be nothing more than a bonus to the banks for causing the biggest financial crisis since 1929 
 In my view, more banks should have been left to fail, as a stark warning of the consequences of failing to manage banking activities 
 We heard the phrase ""too big to fail"" over and over, yet nothing has been done to break up hegemonies in order to protect the economy, and society, from recession in the future"

2660,"It depends on your financial goals 
 Lets suppose you want to want to have significantly high returns from your investments 
 This means taking more risk in order to achieve your goal 
 Thus I would invest a large portion of the available capital in gold to use it as a back-up to mitigate potential losses from other investments so that I have capital to invest in the future to retrieve those losses, or at least a percentage of it 
 If you want to take a conservative approach, I would recommend holding from 15% to 20% of gold in your porfolio 
 Many may thing having a 20% in your porfolio is excessive, but during a ""black swan"", it can mitigate the losses substantially 
 In my opinion, better safe than sorry 
 Now let's suppose you want a porfolio with moderate return rates and risk 
 You aren't particularly interested in earning very high amounts of money from your investments 
 You prefer moderate/low returns with considerably low risk by holding, for example, a high percentage of AAA bonds in your porfolio 
 In this escenario, I would recommend holding from 10% to 15% of gold since you still need some kind of insurance 
 If you are a paranoid, though, and you are worried about possible economic downturns or ""black swans,"" you may want to hold 20% of gold, possibly more 
 During the financial global crisis we saw how CDOs, even the safest, lost their value and caused billionaire losses to banks and other financial institutions 
 Therefore gold, in case of recession, can back you up against it to a degree, so it is wise to have a big portion of your porfolio in gold in a situation like that 
 And as we saw in this week's lessons, it is better to invest in gold when the economy is stable and its price is relatively low because it's price will raise excessively during an economic downturn 
 Am I wrong 
 Please feel free to correct me if you think so 
 I'll very much appreciate your feedback"

 Granted, their point was that one needed to look at the whole picture instead of just the last return, but comparing the arithmetic averages of the return seems misleading to me (especially after the earlier videos on common mistakes people make) 
  It seems to me that the average return should be computed as follows:  Stock A: ( (1 + 1%) * (1 + 1%) * (1 + 13%))^(1/3) - 1 = 4.85% Stock B: ((1 + 13%) * (1+3%) * (1 + 2%))^(1/3) - 1 = 5.89%"

3763,"The investopedia formula is the WACC based on the CAPM model, so it is heavily based on market assumptions, and in some cases it may end up being quite subjective for example when used in certain countries (shallow markets), or when valuing private companies 
 By fortune there is this simpler accounting based WACC that at the end must be the most used in by the company management in their decision making, and it's just  a weight of each kind of  liability (accounts payable, bank borrowing, bonds. 
 ) in contrast with the others,  multiplied by it's  effective rate (anual cost) then you add up all this weighted costs for getting the cost of capital (WACC)

5398,"I was of utter importance for the US government to step in and purchase assets and equity from financial institutions via TARP 
 This indeed allowed the banks to recover and in consequence prevented the world economy from going into a deep depression 
 Had all US banks gone bust then most European and Asian banks would have followed given their broad exposure to the US and Global economies 
 However, this is something that needed to be done this time only and regulations and capital requiremens need to be put in place for banks not to lend beyond their limits 
 Also, it is of vast importance that banks not use client´s money to leverage their own investment decisions 
 So in conclusion, it was unfair to many that banks were bailed out and had their toxic assets cleaned but had it not been done then it would have been the entire global economy who would have been punished 
 The government did stet up its regulation in some cases in hopes that banks will no longer think that they can gamble away and always have the safety net of government to protect their rogue decisions"

 However, Multiples-based valuation methods can also be a difficult task when the company you are trying to estimate its fair value either has a very unique business or operates in muti-industry 
 Therefore, it can be difficult to find comparable companies 
 In the case of negative earnings, you can avoid using P/E ratio if net income of the company is negative by using P/Sale or EV/Sale in case of revenue is positive, or P/BV since Book value is shareholder's equity

 Rafael do you know how this 10% can be justified"

2090,"It is also possible to gain some exposure to movements in gold prices via companies with exposure, such as gold mining equities, however the high volatility on these stocks nullifies the rationale for having the original exposure to gold 
 For any investor, in the long-run it does not make sense to have a large proportion of their portfolio in gold as all asset classes should outperform gold over this time horizon 
 In general, investment losses, particularly through capital depreciation, can only be realised if positions are liquidated and therefore if you are a long-term investor (liabilities ignored), you would not need to significantly hedge against losses in a downturn as asset prices are likely to stabilise over time"

4151,"Multiple-based valuations also make assumptions 
 The methods must assume that many variables are acting as constants in their calculations 
 They can't take into accounts the unknowns, black swan events, and the like 
 So, when you begin to see signs of a bubble, some of the assumptions must be reassessed 
 Additionally, company value must be adjusted 
 During the 2000's, American politicians created a cash for clunkers deal to invigorate the auto market; however, it caused a decline some months later and actually had a negative impact on low income folks due the lack of availability of used cars and used car parts 
 The short term bump given to auto companies was followed by a decline and so using peak performance data would skew results 
 Likewise, we could find similar data for banks and home builders in the years preceding the subprime crisis 
 So, if the numbers are considerably off historical averages, it might yield inaccurate information and poor valuations"

 It was necessary to stabilise the economy and make sure that people gain confidence in the banks and borrow money again 
 When the government gave money to these major banks like JP Morgan, Citi, Goldmansachs, Morgan Stanley and many more, they expected them to lend the money to the people, instead they kept it and didn't lead 
 This lead to the economy falling down even further 
 This is precisely the reason why these banks control trillions of dollars 
 On the other hand by bailing these banks every time some crisis occurs, would lead to carelessness of the banks 
 It is important to stabilise the economy, so the avoid carelessness and bailing out by the government central banks every time, it is important that proper regulations are made by the central bank"

1354,"The TARP was apparently a successful operation in order to abate the financial (and housing) crisis earlier on, but the 'morale' behind it is more contestable than the negative effect it could have on moral hasard and bank responsibility  viewed also from the microfiducial aspects of banking 
 The government revenus come from-inter alia- taxation and the citizens of many countries were thus penalised twice due to the careless speculation of certain wealthy individuals, who through these bail-outs recovered what in fact they deserved to have lost and the common citizen had to pay through a levy of taxes or unfair use of their contributions for State functioning 
 Strictly speaking those responsible for the original crisis should have been the unique payers 
 And the ""complexity of the system"" is strictly speaking, no excuse either 
 When you play with fire (without fully understanding the hasards involved), you generally get burnt and it is no one else's ""fault"" 
  This said, government intervention was like damning the flood from further destruction, but what lessons have we learned 
 The Dodd-Frank Act is a step forward (2010); New regulations have been introduced, but with apparently little impact given the financial resistance in many countries 
 Should the Glass-Steagall Act  ever have been repealed 
 Similar incidents and interventions like TARP, cannot be said to benefit the ""well-being"" of the real economy as a whole, but they certainly should not be treated as the insurance of last resort by the Banking community

 Those 2 factors can mean different things to different companies 
 The multiples-based valuation method can be very risky when used within industries where companies are overvalued 
 Companies with a loss will have a negative per ratio 
 However, one must look at the bigger picture 
 Maybe that company heavily invested in that year for further profits to come"
6782,"How about both 
 It seems to be generally acknowledged that the bailouts helped prevent a crisis at the scale of the Great Depression, but in spite of the Basel policies that have emerged in the wake of the crisis, too few main actors in the banking sector were persecuted for what generally seemed to be criminally irresponsible behavior 
 They can now rest assured that indeed they are too big to fail, and are therefore not incentivized to fundamentally change the behavior of excessive risk taking 
 Most of all, I am continually amazed at how Moodys and S&P managed to not only survive the crisis, but actually seem to still be the main actors in the rating industry 
 The systemic faults that helped create the crisis (the rating agencies being dependent on the goodwill of the banks who paid for the ratings) are still in place 
 Subprime loans may no longer be repackaged as AAA derivatives, but that doesn't mean a similar crisis won't appear in a related area at some point"

1432,"One of the assumptions that could be made when using ratios is that such ratio will remain constant 
 It doesn't necessarily take into account what might happen 
 It looks at a snap shot of how other companies have done, or are currently doing 
 But if there is an expected drop (sales, revenue, industry conditions moving forward), it doesn't really look at that 
 Looking at what lies ahead (although based on assumptions as well), I believe is a more accurate look at what a company is worth (long term view) 
  The other part too is management 
 It's important to know the officers and their track record 
 On the other end, if a company reported a loss (bad quarter/year), the valuation method doesn't really take into account whether or not they might bounce back"
2063,"Hi Nguyen, Sure, hope I can help: In the video ""Fixed income - government bonds: merits - Part 2"" the instructor was illustrating the difference between maturity and duration: He had a wood plank on which there were four evenly spaced glasses 
 He filled those glasses with some water and then placed a larger bottle of water at the right end of the plank 
 The glasses were supposed to represent coupon payments and the large bottle of water at the right was supposed to represent the principal payment for a bond 
 Then he lifted the plank and placed under it a thin piece of wood on which the plank (and cups of water and bottle of water) was balanced 
 The balance point was supposed to represented duration as opposed to maturity which was represented by the bottle (that is, principal payment) 
  The balance point was very close to the end of the plank near the bottle of water right after the fourth glass of water (and not near the center of the plank) 
  Then the instructor mentions ""when I first knew about bonds, I thought the duration was some kind of, I don't know, average maturity 
 Maybe 2.5 
 It's not. Well, let's see, maybe what works, what happens 
 Can you hold there 
 So you can already imagine what is going to happen, now if you let go 
 "" So, then the instructor placed the thin piece of wood more towards the center of the plank (illustrating his idea of average maturity) and the plank falls to the floor and spills all the water

 Importantly, is that we need a diversified portfolio 
 ""Probably even 7 or 8 assets, for you do not know what will happen on the earth""- King Solomon uttered these words in a time of relative peace and prosperity where gold was plentiful 
 The focus in life should not be on our assets, wealth, money etc  There are much more things worthwhile than these things, than to be always fixated on 'money'

 I believe that it was somewhat necessary, but at the same time actions like that can lead to banks being careless 
 At the same time we have to think about the consequences that could have happened, if the governments hadn't had bought the assets

 In my view the main issue here is that this creates a peculiar form of capitalism, which is not pure and truth 
 In its pure form when mistakes are made they have a value which should be paid be the people, organisations responsible instead of being shouldered by the taxpayers around the world

 The moral hazard problem started and even if the government helped to save large important companies, these companies just got used to the help

 They helped their economy recover faster and that was important at that moment 
 The mere fact that the crisis happened had enough impact on the society to prevent similar events happening in the future, at least the near one. Since the reputation of the banks has become really bad throughout couple of last years and I believe that they will not be willing to risk making this situation even more worse by jumping into risky investments 
 On the other hand, the investors, or any people who are more active in financial markets are more aware of what can happen and will act more cautiously, due to the current lack of trust toward banks and financial markets

 Bailout is not exactly what a liberal capitalism is based on and certainly is not what one could call fair 
 On the other hand a collapse  of entire banking system would have a profound consequences for everyone 
 At the point when the decision were made the outcome wasn't certain and we can only judge by the final situation"
2373,"This could be true that it is a bad incentive for banks 
 Conversely, the housing bubble has been such a negative growth incentive for the banks on the whole, that possibly, it was needed in such a crisis time 
 Hopefully, the banks and other institutions will not see it as a repeated occurrence in the future"

8996,"Yes, but with more regulations imposed"
6190,It was necessary for the health of the economy as a whole
2943,"If hedging were a no-cost activity, then it makes sense for an investor to hedge away currency risk 
 Otherwise, the investor is engaged in currency speculation when he or she actually wants exposure, e.g., to the equity risk of a stock portfolio 
 However, hedging has costs 
 I look forward to learning how hedging a portfolio can be done in a cost effective manner"
5481,The bailout of the US financial sector by the Government was an important step
8824,I think is better have a relative small part and monitoring markets to have a larger part but as an unpredictable event is unpredictable it will not be enough but I consider that having part of gold more less rated in your other assets investments is a good metric
5275,"In my hypothetical portfolio I will invest in gold around 10-15% , only to have something with a negative correlation with part of the portfolio and to reduce the overall volatility"
1644,Want to see everyone's point of view
3469,"I believe the Monetary Policies of the FED were necessary to avoid a depression in the economy 
 Unfortunately, the fiscal policies of the government were weak, untimed and politicized more than necessary so there was basically one stone for 2 targets 
 This is the reason of the weak economic growth.\n What would had happened if the FED had no applied the conventional and unconventional policies that it used?\n I don’t know but probably I don’t want to know either 
 The risk would had been monumental 
 \n Thank you Mr 
 Bernanke!\n"
7699,"1 time free pass has been granted but there is no guarantee for 2nd time 
 So bank should ideally learn from there mistake 
 At least that's what us government should be thinking"
3157,"Me too! I fell into the same trap of trying to game the system 
 I'll go back to taking the quiz the old fashioned way of reading each question and answer 
 Greta learning experience for future quizzes"
716,"I think that the assumption might be the optimistic view of a fair market 
 When we use multiples to value the price of a stock we are using the fundamentals of a company financial statistic with the assumption that those multiples are not gonna get worse and that the market sentiment will follow the current valuation 
 I think instances when a major financial crisis is hitting the market and impacting the economy, using multiples would not necessarily project what the fair value of a company is 
 I think that companies that are reporting negative statistics would suffer the same consequences of the constant assumption that things are not going to change in the future"
1909,I'd invest just a fraction in gold to lessen the impact
9125,"Yes 
 About 3%"
4781,"What computer programs would be helpful in managing my investments 
 Spreadsheets are one program that would be useful 
 They would contain different information 
 Programs that allow me construct decision trees would be another 
 Thank you. Regards Peter"
6397,"Ratios tend to work only for long-term valuations 
 Looking at a specific stock there are a lot of short term influence factors which can't be taken into account with this method 
 Also it doesn't work for companies that are in the growth stage, e.g 
 Amazon (also now, but especially years ago) and do not focus on making profits but on growing the market share"
3617,"The companies are both at the same development stage and have the same operating risk  During financial crisis  Companies that have reported loss will have their ratio impacted by their result 
 The ratio will be negative which is not a good comparable"
2517,"Price earning ratios work in most cases but in some cases a mix of different valuation methods 
 Like in this case if the company is faced with a issues and need to reinvest in technologies and process after a prolonged period of success the number could get sckewed in the short term for evaluating"
2522,"Hi, everyone I'm Jack I tutor do taxes and public speaking"
5857,"I believe it was a bad incentive for the banks 
 As it is now the banks that received a majority of the loans are now the biggest banks in the US, and as stated in the lecture the wages of workers has not really increased 
 Even though there are new laws and regulations in place to prevent unethical and extremely risky investments on the part of banks, history has shown us that there has always been a loophole that is exploited 
 As such these new megabanks now have more power"
8682,"Rather a relatively small part, let's say about 15-20% 
  Just to hedge against all risks as seen in the videos"
3874,"I think, it depends on the situation of my portfolio and market 
 To secure my invested capital, I would rather hold some curtain portion of gold on my portfolio when I feel the market acts differently 
 I would not say its portion would be large or small 
 But I would have my optimum portion that I feel it can secure my invested capital"
2148,Pleasure
