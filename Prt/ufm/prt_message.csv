   Too big to fail and the separation of ""normal"" and ""casino"" banking was a big theme at the time but has now lost profile, issue needs to be concluded 
 Moral hazard argument is an excuse for the hawks in central banks to sit on their hands 
 Need to consider this point in the light of alternative scenarios for recovering the economy 
 What are these alternatives?"
2,2,2,4,2016-10-10 18:12:59,"To use ratios efficiently, both variables (in this case, price and earnings), must be representative of the real price and the real earnings of the entity analised 
 Earnings, for example, can be highly volatile 
 For example, the sale of an asset - a building for example - at a very good price, can generate a one-off that will artificially increase the earnings of the company even though they could be incurring in losses in their main activity (for example, insuring) 
  I would not feel comfortable using these kind of methods n these scenarios:if information about all the entities is not audited by third, believable parties,if the entities were not in the same development stage, if there is no historical data to assume that variables are representative of the real, true financial state of the company."

19,18,19,4,2016-04-29 09:39:53,"One interesting feature about how advanced economies went about solving the crisis is that it was the unelected bodies, notably the central banks, who actually saved the collective of all economies from meltdown, not the elected governments or parliaments 
 It is difficult to avoid the forbidden thought that perhaps the elected governments are in fact more powerless to act upon a globalised ensemble of  finance-driven economies than we are led to believe 
 In an ironic twist of the post-Keynesian, post-Steagall Act era, the US decisively turned its previous economic orthodoxy on its head and went full-on for printing money, something that the ECB did only belatedly and with reluctance from some EU members 
 Was this bailout necessary 
 Undoubtedly 
 Did it remove the incentive for exessive risk-taking attitude in certain parts of the financial industry 
 Current pricing of assets suggests otherwise 
 Did it essentially signal that banking really is about privatizing profits and socializing losses 
 I have not seen compelling evidence to the contrary 
 Does it all validate Minsky's now almost forgotten analysis of the systemic risks inherent to a finance-driven type of economic system 
 Or Galbraith's warning of using debt to fuel speculation 
 I do hope not. We are running a colossal amount of debt in our financial system, which will only abate to manageable levels if we inflate it away 
 Alas, this is ideological anathema for current orthodox economic thinking, and you will run out of patience sooner than some ideologues can run out of arguments to prove they continue to be right"

30,29,28,4,2017-09-14 20:32:43,"Hi Pranav,  Great question 
 In general short is riskier than long because your potential losses are unlimited whereas if you are long, your risk is limited to your initial investment 
 For example, if you are short a stock and it goes up a lot, you could potentially lose not only your initial investment, but you could owe more because the stock price could go up infinitely 
 Whereas, with a long position, the lowest a stock can go to is zero at which point you'd lose your initial investment, but wouldn't owe anything more 
 Hope that helps"

35,34,33,4,2017-07-15 05:11:02,"Each method has its advantages and its disadvantages 
 The DCF method, for example, allows the intrinsic value of an equity to be justified, it relies FCF rather than accounting figure 
 On the flip side, DCF is based on assumptions on inputs (growth rate, required return on equity, etc) and it is often difficult to forecast cash flows in cyclical businesses 
 The multiples-based valuation methods are easy to apply and understand and there are fewer assumptions made as with DCF. However, the choice of multiples used can be subjective (or multiples maybe mis-priced by the market)

 During the dot-com era, the subprime mortgage bubble, or perhaps even tech companies today (some big ones of which are valued highly whilst reporting losses for several years in a row)

 The main non-official objective was to keep the financial system working because the country's economy could not survive if the whole economy stops 
 On the other side, one of its most important objectives was to support struggling homeowners and this wasn't achieved even remotely

Further, the index chosen as the comparator may have a minimal represenation of the industry of the company being studies 
 If the company in question is from an industry that very few members of the index are from, it is like comparing appleas and ornages (BLoomberg Market Concepts, 2016)"
62,61,57,4,2017-01-22 02:13:34,"I would prefer a relatively small investment in gold 
 I would assume the risks that I would incur with investing in equities and fix income assets"
63,62,58,4,2016-02-01 19:28:07,"Lorric Now I see that we're not talking about the same subject.\n You are talking about the first In-video quiz 
 I was talking about the first weekly quiz, as per below:"
64,63,59,4,2016-04-25 21:03:23,"As the price of gold is cyclical, I would trade Gold 
 For Example the initial portfolio may have 10% Gold and then whenever the Price of gold goes down there would be more addition 
 This way we can have decent returns and also keep a hedge against uncertain events"
65,64,60,4,2017-06-23 19:27:10,"The assumptions are that the P/E or other multiples of other companies accurately reflect their value 
 During the tech bubble, P/E did not reflect the stock price; likewise after the bubble it didn't reflect it either 
 Negative earnings would give a negative P/E, which would be hard to evaluate without more narrative data"
66,65,61,4,2017-11-17 21:51:32,"Like an example of negative earnings, they will be many situations where the multiple formula (Rule of Three) cannot applied 
 For example, it may be hard to find a comparable company in the same development phase or the same advantage such as manager, competitiveness, and processes 
 Another factor is that even though we can find a comparable company, we can't be sure the price of the company is fairly priced"
67,66,9,4,2016-03-26 22:07:55,"The currently practiced policy of socializing losses while privatizing earnings cannot be in the interest of future stability and society as a whole 
 Indeed the current policy most profits the exact people that caused the crisis with their questionable investment decisions and gives them absolutely no incentives for acting more circumspect in the future"

69,68,63,4,2017-06-15 03:38:26,"I think one assumption is that we assume the ratios are good indicators for future performance 
 However, the earning and stock price are historical information 
 The future earning and future stock price cannot move to direction opposite to the expectation of investors 
 For example, if you get a P/E ratio of 2 for a company, and the ratio of 2 is relatively low to its historical average, so you go ahead buying the stock 
 However, there can have a news that suddenly brings the stock price down further 
 So ratios are good references for investment decisions but not guaranteed gains for investment decisions"
70,69,64,4,2016-12-16 19:53:47,"By making use of p/e ratios and other equivalent ratios we would assume that the market has valued the company at an accurate price 
 However, due to emotions markets tend to price companies at irrational prices - often too optimistic or too pessimistic 
 Therefore, investing purely based on those ratios can be risky 
 Let's take for instance the dot-com bubble 
 Companies were valuated at huge p/e ratios that did not make much - if any - sense 
 Would an investor have relied solely on using p/e ratios he/she would have been very likely to lose a lot of money"
71,70,17,4,2017-09-10 19:52:43,"The assumption is that the market values the comparable companies accurately 
 If a company is undervalued or overvalue, its multiple could not be an effective input to value other companies 
 When market price varies frequently, using PE ratio to value comparable companies may not be appropriate, just like it mentioned that for a company who is under special situation (negative earnings), ratios that related to earning may not be a good choice 
 Finding a comparable company with appropriate multiples could be very difficult, because too many market elements may involved and the choice is somehow subjective"

 From other hand I would invest in different assets that may earn and bring higher profit"
75,74,18,4,2016-02-22 15:48:36,The assumption would be that both the numerator and denominator are realistic numbers to use since these are based on historical view

77,76,69,4,2018-01-21 15:29:28,"Since I have a relatively high tolerance for risk and volatility, I would not allocate more than about 10% of my portfolio to gold 
 I see gold primarily as a hedge for positions I in my portfolio so the percentage I allocate to gold would be impacted by how risky my current investments are"
78,77,22,4,2016-02-27 13:24:51,"In my portfolio gold would take about 10% of all investments at all times 
 I prefer more risky assets with expected higher returns

79,78,70,4,2018-05-23 11:44:54,"I would not hold any assets in gold 
 It all boils down to the rate of return 
 Gold does not yield a return, and even in dire situation such as black swans 
 I would rather bank the interest or divided of different securities and reinvest during those periods"
80,79,71,4,2016-02-10 12:40:58,"Hi Jonas, I would like to chime in 
 The glossaries that are linked are quite extensive 
 Right now I am writing down terminology from the videos and then looking those words up in the glossaries; however it would be lovely if those were pre-linked to the modules so we dont have to search through the glossary 
 Not critical, but helpful"
81,80,72,4,2017-05-21 18:29:58,"So the main assumption that we make is that the company of the same size, development stage and industry most probably performs in the same way hence we can apply the ratios to the company that we evaluate 
 Obviously there are many other factors that may affect the performance of each individual company so relying only on ""comparable"" companies is not a silver bullet 
 For instance we may have 2 tech companies operating in the same domain (ex 
 Business Intelligence) but having completely different technologies 
 As observers we won't know the details of implementation of their products but the difference in it may yield absolutely different sales KPIs because of some limitations of one of the products 
 So technological factor that was not taken into account will play a key role in stock pricing despite the same size/industry/development stage of the company 
 Dot-com bubble as well as current state of the tech industry proves that this approach is not the best 
 Just because it's a brand new startup with technology ""similar"" to those which other successful companies have doesn't necessarily mean that it should have the same value 
 There are a lot of startups with no or not sustainable business model that are overvalued at this moment because of the hype around them 
 We can not rely on their prices when evaluating another unicorn 
 That leads us to another assumption that we use - comparable company is fairly evaluated 
 Unfortunately it is not always true"
82,81,73,4,2018-03-05 10:31:04,I would put about 15% of my portfolio in gold
83,82,74,4,2018-08-12 15:56:40,"Using multiples assumes that other comparable companies are fairly valued 
 If they are all over-valued, then we will also over-value our estimate of the stock price of the firm we are evaluating 
 I would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods at the height of  _domain_  bubble or sub-prime bubble 
 Maybe P/E using time-averaged earnings is a better metric for a company that just reported a loss, to smooth the data and avoid getting a negative share price"
84,83,36,4,2016-04-21 19:38:19,10-20% of my portfolio should be gold
85,84,75,4,2017-04-02 23:03:56,"I would have a small part maybe around 20% of my portfolio in gold 
 This is mainly because, gold can be used as a hedge against unlikely events

  I think I'm just trying to figure out which kind of rare (black swan like) macro conditions  could lead to an improbable US or UK, default

 I'm an active investor/trader who uses Technical Analysis, I don't buy actual gold I buy the ETFs that track gold prices 
 Thus, it means as an investor one needs to know when the price of gold is going up and when it's going down

 I think if the black swan is a natural disaster (like Fukushima) then I can probably give up as it ""could have in no way"" been predicted

 Like management, policies implemented by the country where these companies reside, etc. Also when taking some assumptions by trying to set similar companies, we loose the perspective that they are certain factors that are particular to a company and can't be shared by others"

 I think I won't be comfortable using the multiple-based method to deduct a share price when conditions in the industry or in the economy differ materially from those prevailing when the ratio we will use was calculated 
 If a company just reported a loss, I won't use the multiple-based valuation methodology 
 As I believe the company's managerial team is rational, I will be sure they will be taking steps to change the situation, hence any ratio won't reflect the actual situation  of the company and the ratio we can used won't be representative of the actual situation of the company"

 Many technological companies nowadays starts as a negative earning many years, growing on investments, and still are having share value because there is a belief companies will earn after starting up 
 And in such cases the method would fail 
 Selection of right comparable set of companies could be difficult 
 Is Google early days a technological company or advertisement 
 Finally it is just an assumption that company will have similar risks as companies from same category, but in reality each company have it's unique strong and weak sides

The nature of the risks are different, whilst the companies are linked to CEO's, cashflows of the company, etc. Gold is more related to inflation, demand and supply of it in the market, etc. So hedging your assests (equities) with more equities (even if they are on gold companies) would be counterintuitive"

 We also assume they face similar risks 
 Thus we assume that the ratio tool we use to compare these firms are approximately of the same value 
 However, this may not always be the case 
 The  _domain_  boom may have been a wrong time to use the multiple-based valuation method especially if it was to valuate a technology company 
 There were many tech companies that emerged at that time and they were all definitely not comparable to each other, although they were from the same industry and were at similar development stages 
 Negative earnings will reflect poorly on the ratio tools being used for valuation 
 A company may have incurred a loss due to reasons specific only to that firm 
 This may not be the case with all other comparable firms 
 These companies with negative earnings cannot be used in multiple-based valuation"

199,191,141,4,2018-10-22 07:00:19,"One important assumption is that the prices for those comparable companies need to be at their fair value 
 Since we are using their P/E ratio to determine the fair value of our company, it is essential that their prices are firstly fair

 2007 is an example of many periods in history when euphoria in the market pushed up earnings multiplies above 'norms' 
  Generally easy credit or new innovations lead market participants to claim this time is different; however that never seems to ring true 
 Multiple based valuation methods are no easily used on companies making a loss 
 If it was a one-off loss in the current year, and we forecast future positive earnings & cash flows, the method could still be used (assuming we believe the loss to be one off!) I believe any value that we place on a company where we are required to use the stock price in our calculation is going about things the wrong way. We need to perform our own independent valuation, and compare this against the price that the market is willing to offer to us"
202,194,15,4,2016-04-16 22:48:11,"We would be applying trends that apply to a general industry that maybe disproportionately leveraged by highly successful companies 
 So for instance if we look at a P/E ratio of the aerospace and defense industry as a hypothetical 10, we must understand that this 10 comprises of P/E ratios of Goliaths AND Davids 
 Airbus and Boeing will have a P/E closer to this 10 than a smaller company like Dassault Systemes for instance 
 I think I would have been very uncomfortable applying this method if I were investing in the real-estate and housing market during the Celtic Tiger years in the Republic of Ireland 
 As the market itself may have had a high P/E, each individual project was, in my opinion, highly unstable 
 As P/E is a snapshot of the value of the market, it could potentially overestimate the ability of company to bounce back from a loss in relatively healthy market 
 P/E will only become more accurately reflective of this company's ability to bounce back when several of their peers make similar losses in that period, thus lowering the P/E and reflecting the observed company's situation"

 In an emergency the Govt must do what it needs to stop the financial issues from turning into a full panic knowing full well that these actions will have unintended consequences, yet realizing that inaction in this case would be worse 
 Just as in the case of a fire we do not stop to argue about it, we put it out and then we study and implement rules and regulations to prevent the next one (mandating sprinkler systems, improved building standards etc)

 This inadvertently ensures growth, as people continue the consumption cycle based on credit 
 During this cycle the financially less literate fail & govt steps in to assume the loan 
 You have the same situation in India or in non democratic country like Oman where this is done to maintain political stability"

 For these reasons I would minimize exposure to gold (unless as a speculative bet on upcoming QE's etc)"
256,243,151,4,2016-10-11 17:21:37,"In my opinion, since gold is inversely related to the stock market, thus when the stock market is performing well, gold will be performing purely 
 Thus, when the times are good we need to be performing well, so I believe that at any time the largest part of one's money should be allocated in diversified equities and bonds 
 This doesn't mean that we shouldn't give the necessary attention to the insurance gold gives us 
 When the stock market failed in 2008 the price of gold skyrocketed, reaching 2000 USD/ounce 
 That means that even a small fraction of our money in gold can have a satisfying outcome

 In order to make this work, more treasury debt had to be taken on and the banks paid very little for their bailout giving them incentive to just build up more bad debt 
 Now the new increased treasury debt taken on provided the central bank with the monetary resources to buy these toxic asset through quantitative easing 
 This pushed are large amount to new money into the economy 
 This inherently will expose the United States to a higher probability to increased inflation 
 However, increased inflation in not what is occurring at this given time due to decreased financial regulation due to the revocation of the Glass-Stegall act.  This change in financial regulation has allowed the banks to keep more of the money from the quantitative easing and use for market speculation hence taking on more risk and doubling down on the whole process 
 Needless to say, this puts the economy at an even bigger risk 
 Now one of two things will happen 
 Banks will push the money as loans, which is highly unlikely, causing inflation or  the economy will crash, their bets will go bad and they will need to be either bailed out or risk failure

 Of course even at those times having some gold wouldn't hurt 
 Other types of assets are apparently also to certain extent hedge each other against extreme events, for example cache hedges against stock market crashes, and stock market hedges against inflation 
 It's also not exactly free to keep gold once it's obtained, and buying and selling it might be subject to fees and taxes

 In the end, the decision was quickly made by the different central banks as the disaster involved by letting banks sink would have been of a tremendous importance 
 As banks are all correlated, damages would have come global and this would not only somehow punish the financial sector but also the private sector, households, the worldwide situation 
 Bailing out banks has been seen by central banks as a way to stem the upcoming financial crisis, its damages 
 In the end then it seems that they really had no choice 
 The decision of bailing out these establishments was not well welcomed by the populations as it meant that banks and other financial institutions were allowed to do whatever they wanted, do all the mistakes they wanted, the Governments and the Central Banks would always be there to have their back 
 We cannot say likewise for any other kind of company 
 Indeed, a bakery that does not its job well would just close definitely its doors  
  The consequences of the Central Banks’ decision are thus worth worrying about 
 What lessons did Banks really learn from their mistakes then  
  In order to avoid new financial scandals and to monitor more banks’ activity, Central Banks strengthened their expectations in terms of compulsory reserves and prudential ratios ( Bale III,  
 ) 
  This gives less flexibility to banks and aims at restoring the faith people used to have in banks"

  Price is dependent on the nature of the market (Bull or Bear market) 
   Companies that just reported a loss but did well in previous years will have a negative impact from this because P/E ratio only considers the immediate results of the company

 Therefore it would be dangerous to assume a high value of a start-up, based on little or no real earnings of comparable companies 
 For a company with low earnings, as the earnings tend towards zero, surely the ratio will increase to infinity 
 This means that we would have to pay a much higher price to earn the money back, and once this goes negative, the ratio gives no useful information other than the company is losing money 
 The ratio will not tell how big the loss is 
 The reason to invest in a loss making company would be that future expectation of earnings is high, thus the current multiple method using current earnings information would not be useful"

  Maybe the company that is booking loss provisions is more prudent than the others that did not, but it's prudency may lower it's market value as a result

 However, it was also a pointer to the central banks that they have to be more vigilant during the so-called good times, to prevent a recurrence of the samen scenario 
 I do not think  that governments' bailout would encourage banks to be careless- I believe that banks would be more prudent, considering that similar bailout may not be possible if a similar situation arises again"

 Even though market conditions are same, two similar companies show different earnings due to various factors like management behaviour, focus of operation (e.g 
 Facebook can focus towards reducing ads in the feed while Instagram continues to focus on ads) 
  In a highly volatile market, I think, even though the earnings are same over that period/quarter, the fluctuation of price is so much that P/E ratio will change every day - and the change can be lot. In such scenarios, which day to choose for the ratio  
  Company which has reported a loss will show the P/E ratio as Not applicable ( just read that it is industry practice to not show -ve p/E) in that case, you don't have a ratio to compare against so the valuation method would fail"

 If we talk about usual portfolio's, which  controls by  3rd party sides, I'm in doubt that usual investor should hold significant part of assets in gold

 Since you are familiar with accounting, one way to look at it might be that you could value a company in a way that is similar to looking at its balance sheet 
 Perhaps the method taught in this course is similar to looking at an income statement 
 I agree though that it doesn't seem to take into account the present assets the company has, nor liabilities"
350,332,218,4,2016-06-19 17:53:57,"I think, one should consider gold almost as cash in some way. Of course, you can`t pay your bill with a bar of gold, but when we talked about cash, we talked about portfolio reasons - about cash you need in order to use some good opportunity 
 \n I think, I will do it that way: I will define an amount of cash I need for those portfolio reasons, then I`ll enlarge that amount with an emergency fund (6 month of living without income and maybe to start investing from the scratch) and transfere those money in gold 
 As far as I understand, gold has high liquidity, so if I would have to transfere it into cash, that won`t be a problem 
 And simultaneously I will be hedged against stock or currency crash"

353,334,221,4,2017-10-28 08:57:30,"First about the negative earnings, it's very hard to use multiples-based valuation methods when we want to evaluate start-up company 
 Those companies usually will have negative earnings over several years 
 Also combined the factor that its not always easy to access all the data to determine which firm is the good one to compare 
 As for the firms which already has positive earnings, it is also not easy 
 First, how can we determine that the their prices are also fairly evaluated, same for the earnings 
 Second, there are no two firms in the world which are exactly the same 
 Even in the same country, factors like different consumer behavior and local government regulations will also affect the correctness of the measure ratios"

355,335,222,4,2018-03-14 15:47:43,"To start with, I am sure that it depends heavily on the owner of the portfolio and their risk preferences 
 My answer therefore depends on if I choose to add gold to my own portfolio or to my clients' 
   Since I am still very young, the opportunity costs pays a really big role 
 I am also very risk tolerant, so I would choose to hold 5-10% of my assets in gold"

357,337,223,4,2018-01-18 22:33:10,"I would rather keep a small to medium allocation of gold 
 It is smart to have in the case of an extreme event, but I think having too much allocated in gold can severely hinder your returns unless something major does happen (or gold appreciates for whatever reason) 
  I would rather focus on getting returns from my due diligence rather than waiting or hoping something extreme and probably unlikely happens"
358,338,22,4,2016-02-12 22:06:50,"As a financial consultant, I would never tell a client to put a large portion of anyone's wealth in gold 
 While these videos were interesting, and are very accurate,  gold is not always a perfect hedge against inflation 
 I do feel it is a good hedge against political and black swan events 
 But, looking at recent data from J.P Morgan's quarterly market review from 2000-2015, gold is not the best investment 
 Now, it is difficult to discern because gold is part of a commodity basket in this research, but commodities themselves have been the worst performing sector since 2000 
 Mostly the reason for this was from 2011- 2015 with the collapse of oil, decline in gold and silver 
 Of course gold did perform well for many years, and has performed much better than oil these past 2 years, but, it's performance still is not as good as REITs (real estate investment trust) 
  REITs averaged over 12% a year from 2000-2015 
 So, this does not mean everyone should invest in real estate, gold, small caps, etc. But a nice diversified portfolio of investments that might include gold, will perform well 
 After all, one large reason for the 2008 crisis was collapsing real estate, yet it was the best asset class to be in over the past 15 years 
 Gold did not do well in 2011 - 2015, yet there were many global political issues in this time period, especially over the past year 
 Assets will go up and down, so it is best to have a diversified basket of assets 
 Do I own gold 
 Yes, but it only makes up about 2,5% of my total net worth 
 *** Please note, I own gold coins, not an ETF or mutual fund of gold 
 I feel such products are too exposed to the overall market  swings and do not follow the actual price of gold 
 Second, I am talking about the American markets 
 How such investments would have done in Switzerland, Germany, Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Iran, etc. I do not know"
359,339,0,4,2017-12-14 03:47:27,"An important assumption to consider when using ratios in the multiple-based valuation model is that peers in a given industry offer products or services at a similar price and hence should show similar revenue streams 
 The multiple-based valuation method might lose accuracy in peer groups that contains firms that receive revenue in more than one industry type 
 For example, Canon and Hewlett-Packard can be categorized in the peer group of printer manufacturing but HP also produces PCs which may skew the ratio calculated for the peer group being an outlier 
 A company that reports negative earnings may also be contribute towards further skewing the ratio"
360,340,224,4,2018-05-02 09:02:23,"Multiple evaluation method needs that the ration that is taken as reference from a company to evaluate other company

 As long as the company is growing and their is no recession, DCF should work 
 However, it cannot account for instances like the Dot com bubble or the housing market crash - where things were overvalued but there wasn't any real cash to back it up 
 DCF only seems to work for evaluating companies based on the assumption that they will always grow up to be something bigger and better"
365,345,226,4,2017-07-21 04:28:38,"To calculate the profit we must multiply the percentages (plus 100%)

 Maybe is a little silly but parenthesis were not used, so at first I asume it was just to show the period number (or cashflow number) and it didn´t have any relation to the computation 
 Meaning I just took the cashflow and divided by 1.10, then I realized something was wrong and then I noticed if they used the parenthesis I would undestand it rigth away 
 Cashflow/(discount rate) to the period number power 
 I am sorry if it´s to basic, but I´m just documenting my learning experience 
 Hope this will be usefull for someone else"
367,347,159,4,2017-09-10 17:54:20,"The first issue that comes to mind when using multiple-based valuation is that it uses the share price (the P in P/E) to determine value 
 However, it is possible that the share (or even sector or the whole market) could be overvalued 
 Therefore, if you have to be 100% invested then the multiple-based valuation approach is useful as it gives you relative values - but not absolute

As a result, there may be only expenses but not any “earning.”  An example is when Facebook was offering its service to the mass (end users) at no charge and hadn’t acquired any advertisers to pay for the service

 If a company reports a loss in the period of time during which its performance is being assessed, we might have a negative P/E ratio, but over the whole period of the companies existence, the P/E might be positive 
 So, I would dig deep to see whether the reported loss was because of a temporary loss of performance or whether the flaw was really fundamental, before deciding to invest in it or not"

   Holding it ""forever"" is hypothetical and yes assuming no dividends and never cashing out how can you get your ROI?   I will refer you to Warren Buffett with BRK.a & BRK.b (Berkshire Hathaway inc)          He shares the forever holding period and does not pay dividends 
 He calls this; intrinsic value 
 2) 
  From the instructions,  From year t+3 onward, you expect the FCFs to grow at a constant yearly rate of 4% 
   The share price will remain volatile (go up, down and sideways) reflecting the needs of those who buy & sell 
 Since hypothetically, you are holding forever you will benefit from the FCF of a constant 4% FCF. Benjamin Graham , the father of value investing said,  ""In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.”  Price is just what you pay. Value is what you get in return for this price 
 I am a value investor and an Investment Manager 
 I must say that I am a bit disappointed (I am biased) that more was not offered on the fundamentals of value investing 
 I have enjoyed reviewing this course and all the instructors have done a tremendous job of giving a wealth of valuable insight into this field 
 Perhaps, at some future time a course specific to value investing will be offered 
 In fairness, I will add that value investing is a very small minority withing investment management 
 It does hold the majority of of capital but with fewer investment managers 
 There is a high amount of discipline involved among other obstacles

 The way I understand it, is that when central banks buy bond they are essentially lending money to the businesses or financial institutions 
 They are adding money into the economy (another way of creating money besides the conventional ways) 
  They also buy bad assets so that the companies previously holding them can take them off their balance sheets and be free from their burden as you suggested 
 In terms of equities, I'm less familiar partially because in the US, the Federal Reserve cannot buy equities 
 Here's an interesting bit from CNBC about it:     Here's another general article about unconventional policies:     This is indeed an interesting question, and I would be curious to know which bonds exactly were bought, for example, during the GFC and how each specific bond was justified in terms of contributing to the economy"

 On the other hand the government also gave the banks an incentive to make other risky moves that may affect the economy

 In times of bubble-forming, for instance in the dotcom bubble, one would not feel comfortable basing calculations on multiples 
 However, recognizing the first stages in a bubble market is not easy 
 As to companies reporting losses - assuming  these are comparable companies in capital structure, industry and lifecycle, one must investigate what the drivers behind the losses were; might there be an operational loss (litigation of some sort) 
  Were the WACC underestimated for some projects 
 Did the company hedge their currency risks"

 Go to infinity 
 The single equation we use to calculate the terminal value that has (wacc - gcf) is derived using the assumption that wacc > gcf.  Hence if that assumption is violated, then the results are meaningless 
 If you write out the first N terms of the infinite series for the value of the firm, you will see that each term grows larger instead of shrinking

 We assume optimistically that the company will have a certain earning regardless of the situation 
 But the company can have low earnings in the future because of many factors such as climate change, political change and regulation changes etc. As a result, the assumption can be very wide of the mark and result can not be relied upon 
 Now if a company just reported a loss the price to earning ratio will be negative and based on that our assumptions will also suffer 
 But the company have have loss because of his cost due to research and because of the R&D cost it will generate huge earning in the future 
 So if we take multiple valuation method our assumptions will be wrong not to invest in the company"

474,444,222,4,2018-04-01 12:36:23,"At the momment, a lot of occasions to which gold could serve as a hedge are prevailing in the minds of the investors 
 For this reason, depending on the strategy used in a particular portfolio, I would give a relatively large weight to gold 
 Political tension, has been around for long especially in developing and under-developed economies but also developed markets and for most the biggest players in the world economy (USA, Russia, China) show a severe niveau of uncertainty on a political level 
 The tone between the US and Russia starts to get rougher again, still far from the level reached during the Cold War, but still alarming 
 The military involvement of the US in Syria also creates a lot of distrust among its political ""partners"" 
  The fear of a nuclear conflict between the US and North Korea is from my point of view the most prevailing negative possibility influencing investors' mindsets 
 In addition, as the stock market boomed in 2017, a slow down in economic growth as a highly likely event to occur 
 I do not expect the stok market to fall at an alarming rate to a new bottom, but even a relatively little retreat is a good reason why the position of gold in a portfolio, which allows its implementation to stock up 
 The fact that natural catastrophies are more likely to happen in the future due to the increased pace of climate change, shows that a large portion of a portfolio devoted to gold, represents security as events like Fukushima of hurrican Harvey might occur more frequently 
 At last, I am highly concerned with the economic problem of scarcity 
 Even tough people and corporations develop new methods to extract more natural resources and at a faster pace, natural resources are not infinit, which will in the long run drive the price of gold anyways 
 This might not be a reason for an immediate upgrade of one's gold position in a portfolio, but definitely a point to consider as time passes by"

 If a the Fed and other central banks had not intervened a much deeper crisis would have occurred 
 The central banks had to keep the liquidity in place so that economies could still function 
 The Fed had to expand its balance sheet to salvage the international banking system   The crisis itself was not caused by the banks themselves, even though there were some rogue banks and other entities involved in the system 
 The real problem was (and still is) international imbalances in the global economy and in particular USA and China 
 There is always a potential problem of banks not being sufficiently risk averse and taking on too many risks knowing that they will be bailed out by the central banks 
 Central banks have introduced macro prudential controls to try and limit this exposure 
 However breaking up the banks may not help 
 Lehman's was not a large bank but it was so interconnected with the rest of the banking system that it created a major liquidity crisis 
 If the government had known that letting Lehman's go would cause such a crisis they would not had let it go into bankruptcy 
 The major problem at the moment is that central banks around the world are trying to manage their economies with a monetary policy rather governments using a blend of fiscal and monetary policy 
 So yes I do believe that central banks have tried their best to stabilise their economies but with a limited tool set they are unlikely to achieve long term stability and therefore we can expect another 2008 crisis unless international structural problems are addressed 
 Given the difficulties of trying to a get agreement in a group like the EU it is going to be even more difficult to get agreement amongst the major global economies (despite meetings like the G20) 
  As long as each economy attempts to optimise itself it will result in sub optimisation of the economic system as a whole 
 Thus risk will persist but so will opportunities"

 There is of course a cost to liquidation of gold that may not exist with cash plus the insurance costs of holding gold 
 With that being said, I would be inclined to hold between 5 and 15% in gold depending on the global stability outlook

 Yield is simply calculated to give potential buyers a quick indication whether a bond should be bought compared to others 
 Yield is based on the present value of cash flows a bond produces 
 Given coupons and face value are not changed, you won't get the same yield as to newly issued bonds 
 Yes, the reverse case happens when interest rate is dropped 
 Just imagine that when interest rate decreases, newly issued bonds will have lower coupon rate relative to what you are holding, thus it makes your bonds relatively more attractive to investors and they have to pay higher price

  Do you burn the bondholders

517,481,82,4,2016-09-27 09:45:40,"In the case of the 2008 crisis it maybe was a necessary thing to bail out the banks, one of the main reason being the fact that it was the ultimate resort for the US government to do so 
 If that didn't happen, we might have got into a worse situation than the one in 1929 
 But if the government is willing to bail out the banks every time they get into trouble, they will get this bad incentive that they can do whatever they want because the government got their back (moral hazard) 
  It is like we are rewarding people for 'messing things up' instead of doing a good job. The bailout was funded with taxpayers money and look at the consequences in the US (and other countries) (unemployment rates rose, people lost their homes. 
 ) 
  (Big) banks are too big to fail because they can have big consequences for the overall economy 
 But  as it was the case in the US, I believe that this does not mean that the government should not look at early signs 
 For example: what if the mortgage brokers-business was regulated 
 Could it be possible that they wouldn't give away mortgages to people who could not afford them and first looking at the financial situation of their clients 
 Could it be possible wouldn't even create bad mortgages 
 But on the other hand, we also saw the creation of new financial products, like the Mortgage Backed Securities and other derivates 
 Nobody knew what was in the former products 
 They were in some kind of way too sophisticated to understand them clearly 
 So in the one hand, some regulation might have weaken the effect of the crisis and maybe the government would not have bailout the banks 
 On the other hand, the innovation of new financial products cannot be halted 
 In this case, risk will always come into play 
 Mix this up with greed and fear, the impact on the economy when things go wrong, can be big. Maybe a last thing to weaken this impact: present the bill to those who get us into those situations"

 A multiple based valuation gave us an estimate of the valuation of the company, but it should be followed by an analytical study of the economy of the sector, to see wether the industry is not going to suffer from any shortage of the commodity it uses to produce its product, and we should also look at the overall economy of that country's equity, to manage the inherent market risk"

561,521,294,4,2016-08-26 21:00:50,"In my opinion, multiple based evaluation can also deviate drastically from the actual value as we use comparison between two companies 
 This means, we assume that both the companies will have similar growth rate, weighted average for cost of capital and similar cash flow 
 Both these companies will be at a similar stage of growth 
 But I believe it is not necessary, both will see similar returns 
 Maybe due to certain problems, the market share for one may drop and rise for the other 
 Innovation within the company may also lead to the same 
 I believe if we used the multiples method for companies like Apple and Facebook, we would have undervalued their price per share, so finding similar companies to compare is difficult and the prediction can be wrong depending on the innovation and strategy of the companies 
 If a company has reported a loss, we could check for the NPV for that company to decide if it is appropriate to invest 
 Another thing that we could do is, valuate the prise of the company, using DCF with values available for the last 5-7 years, this would give the value of the company, including the loss for the current year 
 I believe in this case, using multiples would not be appropriate as the value would show depreciation value for that particular ration 
 Even though the DCF valuation is cumbersome, it should be used when the valuation is critical 
 Using MS-Excel to calculate companies value with the DCF method is comparatively time saving"

  Its management quality was exceptional, great dividend payout, great growth levels, low to zero debt and the business will continue to grow at these levels for the next 5- 10 years

 The real focus was on economy and any medicine, even if steroids, that would work and not on creating precedents and right incentives

 On the incentive and precedent part, we should punish those whose decisions might have resulted in the current circumstances, an elaborate inquiry, proper judicial scrutiny and adequate punishments for the  accused 
 In addition, the loopholes that are found from these investigations could be properly filled by appropriate legislation 
 In conclusion, under the crisis it is important to handle the situation at hand and try to resolve it in the soundest possible means, than waiting and doing nothing under the garb of principles and let the crisis engulf and decimate the investor confidence and in turn bring down the system 
 I am also, strongly against any intervention of central banks in the regular functioning of the banking system apart from the laid down rules as per the constitution or law.

 Many companies, which had nothing to do with technology, changed their names just so that they could trade at higher P/E ratios

 This method is also very tricky in case of companies with negative earnings 
 For example, Amazon and Twitter regularly post annual losses

 Companies may work in the same sector and partly do the same business but they are not comparable because they have different business models, divisions, work in different regions etc. For instance, try to use multiples to for Apple and HP or Microsoft and IBM or Google and Facebook 
 As companies try to differ from their competitors to become successful, it seems more unlikely to find a perfect match 
 Another problem with multiples is that we assume that the benchmark company is priced fairly 
 However, it can hardly be that way. Though, we can use regression to get a sort of ""average"" price, I don't believe that it isn't always possible to find several similar companies listed on a stock exchange to conduct such analysis"

 Yes, specially when because of policy the expected rates of return where distorted, for example with the Fed or Central Banks easing money to the financial system and lowering the interest rates that in turn would have lowered the expected rates from investors in equities which by using the Multiple-based Valuation Methods  would have driven the prices up making the companies more valuable fictitiously

 Even more, the Banks know since they are so big and essential in the everyday of peoples' lives, they know the government has them protected since they have the capital to do 
 Moreover, post financial crisis, asset prices were at all time lows

 There are some good reasons to keep system-relevant banks alive, but this can also lead to a non-chalance behavior where banks will take on too much risk in the future 
 And then, according to Mark Häfele/UBS, the salary of the average worker has not really increased, but this has mainly helped investors

 Fortunately the situation is better now as banks have been required to be more heavily capitalized to better withstand shocks 
 I do like the idea of clawing back bonuses of execs who make bad decisions and defraud the public 
 It seems these people are rewarded no matter how badly they perform, or how many people they hurt 
 I do wonder if we would have been better off giving some TARP money directly to taxpayers, as many banks held onto substantial amounts of the TARP money rather than loaning it out as intended 
 Mortgage restructuring programs were also not helpful for most people who were ""underwater"" on their mortgages (i.e 
 The loan was bigger than the market value of the house) - these restructured loans were difficult to get, took months for approval, and were undercut by scam artists promising to ""help"" the process

 By combining many value drivers into a point estimate, multiples may make it difficult to disaggregate the effect of different drivers, such as growth, on value 
 The danger is that this encourages simplistic – and possibly erroneous – interpretation It's Static, a multiple represents a snapshot of where a firm is at a point in time, but fails to capture the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of business and competition 
 It can have Difficulties used to make comparisons of relative value 
 But comparing multiples is an exacting art form, because there are so many reasons that multiples can differ, not all of which relate to true differences in value 
 For example, different accounting policies can result in diverging multiples for otherwise identical operating businesses 
 The use of multiples only reveals patterns in relative values, not absolute values 
 If the peer group as a whole is incorrectly valued (such as may happen during a stock market ""bubble"") then the resulting multiples will also be misvalued"

 In its pure form when mistakes are made they have a value which should be paid be the people, organisations responsible instead of being shouldered by the taxpayers around the world

 Any time companies differentiate their product and/or service, it's likely that different factors determine the valuation of that company

 The Troubled Asset Relief Program was therefore an important measure to prevent the Americans from the worst

 People find it very cumbersome and it's also prone to mistakes 
 So they tend to take shortcuts, they tend to take simpler valuation methodologies like price to earnings, cash flow yield, dividend yield, to get an answer to what the fair value is.""   There is however a very important assumption we make when we use ratios we observe on the market (like price-to-earnings) to value other comparable companies

 Were there instances in history where you would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies

 Also when we look at the stock market,  there was a time (post 2008) where due to the uncertanty of the global economic situation it was very difficult to deduct a probable FCF. When we have uncertanty in the market due to macroeconomic unstability I would avoid using a  DCF valuation method

Every advisor, brokerage, or mutual fund company has suggested model portfolios with varying risk levels as a starting point for portfolio allocation 
 They often have a series of questions to help determine your ""risk tolerance"" 
 .I don't put much faith in them 
 It is extremely hard to actually determine your risk level when the investment outlook is rosy 
 You learn your true risk tolerance when times are bad.  We lean how well our homes are constructed when a hurricane hits 
 If you're an active investor, you would have to assess each purchase or sale as to how it fits into your risk profile and current asset allocation 
 You would be ""rebalancing"" with each sale or purchase 
 The concept of rebalancing seems to be more applicable to a passive investor 
 They will likely hold assets longer than an active investor who is frequently buying and selling 
 In rebalancing, a investor can rebalance every year or two or rebalance when their allocation drifts more than 5% or so from their target 
 When rebalancing, you might want to also consider the costs to rebalance  and tax implications

 Where the government dropped the ball was to give the bankers complete freedom to do whatever they wanted with the 3.5 Trillion USD of the taxpayers money 
 This could have been avoided if a society had a control signal to modulate corruption between the politicians and the bankers 
 This is a signal similar to what the central banks use to modulate the economy, by controlling interest rates 
 This signal is called educating the masses of the white collar corruption that exists in practically all nations of the world 
 Ultimately a sound economic functioning of a society is the responsibility of its own citizens, thus a society should create adequate infrastructure, such that maximum transparency is created at all levels of the government 
 Once the people of a country realise that it is the very rich and the high powered government servants are the root cause of this economic meltdown, where millions of its citizens will suffer its bad consequences, then society as a whole will realise that in order to have a sustainable system in which even the crooked amongst us also do have a need to survive, then it becomes mandatory to mitigate corruption and not to exceed it beyond a certain threshold level for all of its citizens to live in moderate stability and safety of its societal structural systems, i.e 
 Political, legal, educational, commercial, etc. This is ultimately a problem of squarely looking at our own human nature, which at a fundamental level does not believe that honesty and honor has any place in today's economic market place, once people realise this flaw and take acceptable actions to change the values of a society, by raising our children not only think of themselves but also our neighbors well fare, till then even the courts will NOT be able to solve this problem, as we are witnessing in USA today

811,739,15,4,2016-04-03 17:05:34,"Just a few thoughts 
 It can be hard to value companies using multiples based on the business strategy they employ 
 For example valuating Amazon could be difficult as part of their strategy includes re-investing all their positive cashflows towards new products, research and development, and property, as examples 
 Sometimes, it's hard to use PE ratios where there is no likely comparison 
 Any values that result of that comparison will not help an investor reach a fair value 
 Further, as a summary, I have found the following explanations as to why multiples can distort the full picture of a company's valuation 
 There are a number of criticisms levied against multiples, but in the main these can be summarised as:   Simplistic: A multiple is a distillation of a great deal of information into a single number or series of numbers 
 By combining many value drivers into a point estimate, multiples may make it difficult to disaggregate the effect of different drivers, such as growth, on value 
 The danger is that this encourages simplistic – and possibly erroneous – interpretation 
 Static: A multiple represents a snapshot of where a firm is at a point in time, but fails to capture the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of business and competition 
 Difficulties in comparisons: Multiples are primarily used to make comparisons of relative value 
 But comparing multiples is an exacting art form, because there are so many reasons that multiples can differ, not all of which relate to true differences in value 
 For example, different accounting policies can result in diverging multiples for otherwise identical operating businesses 
 Dependence on correctly valued peers: The use of multiples only reveals patterns in relative values, not absolute values such as those obtained from discounted cash flow valuations 
 If the peer group as a whole is incorrectly valued (such as may happen during a stock market ""bubble"") then the resulting multiples will also be misvalued 
 Short-term: Multiples are based on historic data or near-term forecasts 
 Valuations based on multiples will therefore fail to capture differences in projected performance over the longer term, and will have difficulty correctly valuing cyclical industries unless somewhat subjective normalization adjustments are made"

 The people arguing that in doing so the government might have incentivise the banks to issue bad loans simply neglect the fact that even in the absence of such bailouts the probability of bad asset/loan has been non zero 
 So, in my view the entire argument about TARP being an irrational move is a rather misplaced one, since it unduly overweights the probability that the banks will continue to give more bad loans 
 On a more careful note, I do believe that a more thorough study needs to be carried out which actually starts looking into the percentage of under performing loans/assets in the aftermath of TARP

869,338,145,4,2016-02-15 16:09:32,"Of course it was necessary to have these bailouts because of the liquidity crisis 
 The bailout had nothing to do with excessive risk taking, it had to do with allowing investment banks and commercial banks to merge 
 This allow investment banks to be over leveraged 
 Not to mention allowing insurance companies to also own assets that had nothing to do with insurance, such as AIG. AIG failed not because of its insurance business, but because of other assets that it owned 
 This is where the incentivizing of risk happened 
 Allowing these banks to be leverage 30 to 1, is where the risk was. Allowing banks to become mega banks, also creates a ""too big to let fail"" risk 
 And this is what happened over the course of many decades, ending in 2008 
 Yet, even with the bailout, which was necessary because of the loss of liquidity and the possible ensuing depression, the real issue is that banks are still large 
 And that, investment banks still can own commercial banks 
 These all must be separated, and get smaller 
 Then, if one bank fails, it will be much smaller, and there will be a less risk to liquidity 
 Then no bailout would ever be needed 
 Think of it this way, Lehman Brothers controlled over $7 trillion of assets before it collapsed 
 This was a mix of money markets, investments, bonds, marketing making transactions, etc.  When it failed, $7 trillion of assets were at risk of becoming illiquid,  which is why there needed to be a bailout, which for Lehman, did not come and the ensuing panic followed 
 The bailouts were unfortunately necessary, it's all the other risk taking and mergers that are not necessary and promotes excessive risk to the world economy"

   And by saying ""it all goes bad"" it is meant a combination of factors mainly focusing in insolvency ( the company not being able to meet its financial obligations, specifically debt ones)

 Governments are therefore in critical need of smart and expert regulators to help them formulate their plans 
 The banking sector will first have a hard time to adapt to increasing regulation but a new generation of bankers will hopefully help succeeding in improving the sector over time 
 There are many other industries that are much more regulated and there's no compelling reason why banking should be an exception, especially considering the vital role it has in the economy"

 There are several downsides of using these methods 
 For example, methods like price-to-earnings are quite simplistic because they disregard some of the important information related to company or economy and this will cause errors in interpretation 
 In additon to this, these methods are useful in understanding the short-term performance of company and do not include cyclical fluctuations in the economy

 However, sometimes it is not the case 
 When there is a bubble in the industry or in the economy, the price of the company's shares could be overvalued, and this will lead to an erroneous valuation of the company that we are analyzing 
 The problem is that it is usually difficult to spot a bubble before it burst 
 I believe that performing a valuation based on multiples in case of a company that just reported a loss, is not appropriate 
 This is mainly due to the fact that it is extremely difficult to find a comparable firm, since it should be in the same development stage and it's not easy to assess the conditions that led to a negative profit for our company"

 In terms of banks bad incentives I believe this would only be a problem if banks ""coordinate"" and fail all at the same time 
 If only certain banks pursue more relaxed lending policies and their bankruptcy would not impact the economy then there is no reason for the Central Bank to intervene and bail them out. Additionally, competitor banks could pursue a strategy of waiting for other banks to fail (provided these continue to sell sub-prime financial products) in order gain additional market share

 Taking  Lehman Brothers for example, they could have very well been used by other major banks as a comparator however, they quickly went belly up when the housing crisis hit when they had just previously been believed to be a sound bank

 It is dangerous to use multiple-based valuation methods in overvalued markets (bubbles) and in volatile markets

 So I vote for the American way. As far as the bad incentive for the private banks part, I think it can be issued by penaltized in the future these banks, by forcing the CEO and all the major shareholders, to pay with there personal fortune before bailing out the bank

 To curtail possible consequences such as banks becoming careless in their investment activities, the government, through its central banks can come up with policies that will impose requirements on banks to ensure that these banks will continue to exercise due diligence in screening their investment options in the future

 This probably then also depends on the current condition of the market and the ability to predict what is going to happen in the market - given that the price of gold also fluctuates, we then need to measure that risk against the risk of other prevailing options 
 Given a large enough portfolio with sufficient capacity to diversify, it is probably prudent to hold on enough gold (then again, how much is enough is another question and calculation altogether) such that if other assets are affected, the gains from gold will be able to offset those losses 
 Of course, this is dependent on whether one has such capital to place as principle in the first place, and whether one currently requires liquidity for living purposes

 The scenario does embark upon someone's decision to see what optimal portfolio should be constructed of 
 Many asset classes may be taken into consideration then, but Gold, a debatable instrument, can act as an anchor and at the same time will cost us our interest from other investments 
 So the optimal mixture has to be decided upon after a careful consideration of the PESTEL factors along with the volatility of the other assets to be involved in the portfolio along with the consideration of the reward obtained for a risk established 
 The risk aversion class and the nature of the investor will also play part in the decision of deciding the portfolio

 Therefore a continuous portfolio allocation is needed and should be adjusted accordingly to the events that occur in the market

 However, it only reduces and will never eliminate risky behavior 
 The consequences of the asset buying programs throughout the global economy are yet to be felt and could lead to serious problems 
 However, we have the ability, although much will depend on fiscal policy as monetary policy has been virtually exhausted, to negate the possible negative effects of QE

 Given the annualized 9% return for the past 45 years, it does not seem unreasonable to have at least 10% of a portfolio dedicated to gold 
 Going forward, I see a need to increase this allocation 
 The Eurozone is a wonderful idea in theory, but given the lack of political will to create the institutions required for its survival, it appears headed for years of stagnation if not outright collapse 
 Add to this the rise of China, even though we are seeing it slow down a bit, which could ultimately lead to great unrest by its massive population 
 As well, the enormous political quagmire that is the Middle East adds to the geopolitical risks running throughout the world economy 
 And let us not forget the zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) and massive debt held by many countries, especially developed ones 
 Add to this, declining birth rates, sluggish productivity, technological advances that are diminishing job prospects and thus the taxes required to fund generous pensions laid out years prior 
 Given the political and social risks and changes the future inevitably holds, ones that I see as negative for world equity markets, as well as the almost assured need for inflation (money creation) to pay debts, it may be that a portfolio should have an allocation to gold nearing 25%+"

1173,1012,454,4,2017-02-17 02:32:04,"From everything I have read about the financial bailout issue, I do not think that a clear answer emerges 
 The situaiton is complex and a full assessment cannot be carried out from a simple economic standpoint, but must consider its effects on public policy and sentiment as well 
 During the time of the crises, the decision by the US Fed to come up with the TARP was necessary to allow liquidty to effectively be injected into the monetary system by increasing bank lending post-TARP 
 Illiquidity at the time, aside from leding to tepid growth, was also leading to the meltdown of many aspects of the financial systems such as the money-markets 
 At the end of the day if this was allowed to continue it would have led to solvency and operational cash issues for many companies 
 Combine this with the interconnectivity of large institutions in the market through derivate products like Credit Default Swaps, and you now end up with the primary issue of insitutions that are Too-Interconnected-To-Fail (TIFF): a collapse of any one systematically important instituion would lead to a chain-reaction causing other connected instituion to collapse in tandem 
 This TIFF problem was the main reason that the bailout was, at some level, necessary: a further meltdown would have had dire consequences on main street, wages, and employment levels with large corporations being the next in line to feel the brunt of a lack of operational liquidity following the banks 
 The other side of this issue is that of moral-hazard: did this sentiment that the bank bailout was imminent spur such egregriously careless risk-taking by the banks, and will it continue to do so in the future 
 Unfortunately, I beleive that this might still be the case 
 Even though the US did implement the Dodd-Frank Act, asking structurally significant institutions to carve out a living-will and raised capital requirements for banks, little was done to sovle the core issue of TIFF 
 Under current law, one can simply underwrite a derivate like a CDS without actually having to earmark any capital to cover the insurance capital that the CDS guarantees 
 The total market size for CDS alone is upwards of 20 trillion USD. I personally do not believe that anything short of incresed oversight and reguation of the derivatives markeplace will solve the issue of TIFF 
 Without solving this issue, central banks might have to attempt another bailout, which will, in all likelihood, be block by polical parties/ congress in response to populist anti-bank sentiment 
 At the end of the day we might just see the CBs witht heir hands tied, watching as the market collapses in its entirety 
 Warren Buffet called these derivative products 'weapons of financial mass destruction'

 Finally, companies that report losses don't have a P/E ratio defined, thus it is impossible to take them into account in this valuation method"

1222,1045,134,4,2016-03-03 01:12:33,"Why not always use multiples-based valuation methods 
 Investing in companies with negative earnings is a high-risk, high-reward proposition 
 However, using an appropriate valuation method such as DCF or EV/EBITDA, and following common-sense safeguards – such as evaluating risk-reward, assessing management capability, and using a portfolio approach – can lessen the risk of investing in such companies and make it a rewarding exercise 
 •Is the unprofitable phase likely to be temporary or permanent 
 For a mature company, a potential investor should determine whether the negative earnings phase is a temporary one, or if it signals a lasting, downward trend in the company’s fortunes 
 If the company is a well-managed entity in a cyclical industry like energy or commodities, then it is likely that the unprofitable phase will only be temporary and the company will return to profitability in future 
 •Early-stage companies are not for the conservative investor: It takes a leap of faith to put your savings in an early-stage company that may not report profits for years 
 Investing in early-stage companies may be suitable for investors with a high tolerance for risk, but stay away if you are a very conservative investor 
 •Check valuations and evaluate the risk-reward: The Company’s valuation should justify investment decision 
 If the stock appears overvalued and there is a high degree of uncertainty about its business prospects, it may be a highly risky investment 
 The risk of investing in an unprofitable company should also be more than offset by the potential return 
 •Management is the key: Determine whether the management team has the credibility and skill to turn the company around (for a mature entity) or oversee its development through its growth phase to eventual profitability (for an early-stage company) 
  •Use a portfolio approach: When investing in negative earnings companies, a portfolio approach is highly recommended, since the success of even one company in the portfolio can be enough to offset the failure of a few other holdings 
 The caution not to put all your eggs in one basket is especially appropriate for speculative investments"

1227,1049,99,4,2016-09-14 23:46:37,"By allowing banks to borrow money for free the government has spurred speculation in the stock market probably creating more bubbles 
 At the same time, government could require the banks to loan the money out or could loan directly to businesses and states with the stipulation that it be used either for creating new jobs or working on infrastructure 
 This would put more spending cash in the hands of those who don't have enough and cause them to increase spending, thus improving the economy 
 As much as I hate to admit it, I believe the bailout was probably necessary given that the government was not going to use the money to stimulate the economy in other ways.\n\n This does create bad incentives for the banks since there is little downside from gambling with the economy 
 Unfortunately, governments are too beholding to money and will do little to inconvenience them"
1228,1050,19,4,2016-04-13 21:30:57,"I believe what many of the world's central banks did and the Fed in particular was necessary to not run the risk of getting into a global 1930 style depression 
 However, the point about creating an incentive for banks to be careless should not be taken lightly, and it is a very valid one. The question is, what proactive steps should the government take to ensure financial stability 
 One approach could be to do a thorough review of regulations governing banks 
 Banks play a vital role in the global economy and as such should not be allowed, by law, to take undue risks 
 There is an obvious precedent for this:  while US banks were reeling near bankruptcy in 2009, Canadian banks seemed to barely notice a financial crisis was in the making 
 None required bailouts and Canada emerged from the crisis with only a minor recession 
 Why?  In part because Canadian banking laws prohibit banks from participating in overly aggressive financial engineering (synthetic CDOs, etc) 
   Mortgage loans require proper down payments and employment verification, as they should 
 Somehow, US banks were left to figure these out for themselves,  with the result that they took on way too much risks while seemingly not caring who they lent money to 
 Too much regulation often causes red tape and inefficiencies in an economy 
 I'm not proposing to add regulations, but rather review those in place and implement the right kind of regulations so banks are required to play their proper role of providing financial liquidity and stability in a countries' economy"

 B)There were instances in history where I would not have comfortable using multiple valuation methods to value companies when companies are not similar or comparable  
  c) companies reported the lost had the following problems: - The  total cost is higher than revenue -The company does not make advertisements -The company has a problem of the quality of management  - The cost of labor and raw materials are high - The company sticks on many debts - The company does not pay dividends  - The company doesn't have a qualified staff"

 Even though it easy to say that the government is giving the wrong incentives to the private banks but it is clearly doing what it can which is only controlling and performing their side of the bargain, a level regulations need to be introduced when the government is giving incentive the banks need to be held accountable to clear plans to what they intend to do with the money

 I have not felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value technology stocks as the multiples tend to be inflated and not representative of current profit and many times have negative earnings

 First we find comparable listed firms, second we compute ratio of market value / earnings 
 Subsequently we infer the value of the firm we are interested 
 There are other factors we must address using multiple based valuation

 Negative earnings) then the price should be lower than the other companies with similar assets"

 I think bailing out rightfully helps the banks to serve their purpose in the economy 
 Bottom line is without banks, economy will not grow 
 However,  banks' engagement in businesses that may run into high risk of having Troubled Assets (TA) needs to be controlled and regulated by regulatory organizations 
 In case of US, as far as I am aware, weak and fragmented regulations lead the banking system into trouble 
 I live in Canada and I know Canadian banks are tightly regulated based on risk evaluation, market saturation, etc.  That is to say banks simply do start any new investment in highly competitive and already saturated sectors such as retail 
 In an evidence, Canadian banking system did not experience any of the trouble US banking systems have suffered from 
 This includes 2008's economical crisis 
 To conclude, I think this is more on regulatory bodies and less on banks to ensure government will not be required to run another TARP in future"

1289,1099,107,4,2017-09-10 05:44:51,"My answer to this issue is yes for both 
 During the subprime crisis, had the US government not conduct a bailout of its financial sector, the damage to the economy would have been far greater 
 Not only that but since the US economy is the biggest in the world it would have also affected the entire world economy as a whole negatively much greater than it did. It is also true that this action does seems to inceltivize banks to be careless in their investment activities in the future, coupled with the human psychological factor that the gov't will be there in case a bailout is necessary, plus the fact that this is not the first time something similar to this has happened in the past when something too big to fail is failing 
 I do believe that there is a silver lining to all of this 
 Knowing that events like these are possible, have happened, do happen, and will most likely happen again in the future, for banks, there is no guarantee if and when governments will bail them out if they conduct careless investment activities and so they will still have a greater exposure if they are just banking on a bail out for failed activities, In theory they should still be more incentivised to conduct their investments properly then not due to the risk that they face 
 As for the public who are also investors, this opens our eyes to the fact that greater due diligence is necessary as well us the importance of understanding the financial sector in a deeper level, and not just passively waiting for lagging information"

 A particular instance when I have not felt comfortable using just the fundamental and technical analysis (using multiple-based valuation methods) to value and compare companies, is when investing in emerging economies and industries (i.e 'FANGs') When looking at companies like FB, AMZN, NFLX, and the likes, it is very difficult to come up with a fair valuation by looking at the fundamentals

 Banking has become essential component of the money supply in the economy and allowing banks to close will lead to widespread unemployment 
 That being said, a strict regulatory body must always be present to make sure that banks do not undertake rampant lending in high risk areas 
 This would lead to inflation and in some cases, frauds of biblical proportions which leave the economy in doldrums

Therefore, almost all of the multiples valuations shall be approximations to validate your analysis 2) the multiples approach takes the historical accounting information (Net Income, EBITDA, Sales, etc.) to make inferences about the fair value 
 Therefore, it makes an implicit assumption that the past is representative of the future, which is indeed a strong one. For example, if a Black-Swan-event occurs (with corresponding negative earnings), these figures will be distorted 
 So it appears that both DCF and multiples approaches make some important questionable assumptions

 Looking at what lies ahead (although based on assumptions as well), I believe is a more accurate look at what a company is worth (long term view) 
  The other part too is management 
 It's important to know the officers and their track record 
 On the other end, if a company reported a loss (bad quarter/year), the valuation method doesn't really take into account whether or not they might bounce back"

 When the economy here in the US tanked, that meant that many people who wanted to retire were unable to do so because they took a beating in the financial market 
 As a result, those folks in positions that might have retired could/did not do so 
 This caused stress on the front-end re: new graduates having the ability to enter the job market at a sustainable wage

 In the book ""to big to fail"" the situation is described to try and take the moral hazard into consideration 
 In TARP the big banks also contributed Billions in order to ""bailout"" other banks, thus they also took responsibility for the problems 
 In addition, and as history teaches us, this move was very important and probably save the US economy from a catastrophic future 
 That said, I think that the lack of post program regulation on bankers compensation was a horrible thing to witness as bankers that lost billions received fat bonuses that they did not deserve 
 In conclusion I do support TARP and believe it was justified and worth the consequences, however it was not perfect and should have included additional actions to decrease the moral hazard that washed over wall st"

 Sales, costs, cash flows, P/E, you also have to put everything in the bottle, besides the ratios such as consumer tastes that are changeing day by day, you also have to add other components as much as the quality of management teams that are responsible for future decisions that the firm probably is going to make today 
 Thus, to value a company we should do not to make assumptions or produce insufficient analysis because if we buy a stock, we are buying long-term value which is opposed to a short term, in that case if need a short term we can invest at other investments e.g 
 A bank deposit

 Google's income comes from online ads (more than 80%) which is on its search engine and YouTube videos 
 Another tech giant in online ads industry is Facebook 
 However, Facebook is about social network instead of web searching 
 This makes a total different company culture and decision making for these two companies 
 At the same tech area, Amazon has P/E ratio of more than 180, while Alphabet only has 30s. Even if they are in the same industry, they could be very different"

1507,244,510,4,2017-07-21 05:41:56,"Dear Mr 
 Hoesli, You have mentioned that investments in RE are usually a good hedge from inflation 
 I would like to challenge this statements based on the data from recent RE price development in Russia 
 In Russia we recently faced a number of factors: international sanctions and oil price shock led to increased outflow of capital from Russia which resulted in increased demand for foreign currency and substantial devaluation of Russian ruble 
 Devaluation led to increased prices of imported products and to increased prices of domestic products as well, since domestic producers decided that they can increase prices and still remain competitive in comparison to imports 
 As a result, inflation in the country increased sharply 
 In such a situation it could be logical to assume that if someone invested in real estate in Russia before all these events, she could be ptotected from inflation 
 However, what we witnessed in RE market after those events is that due to all these factors the purchasing power of Russian citizens decreased, since their daily expenses increased, so their demand for RE investments decreased as well 
 Thus, not only the prices of RE assets have not been adjusted for devaluation, they fell even in RUR terms together with rental payments, which also fell 
 Thus, for example, owners of flats, which let them for rent, not only were unprotected from inflation, but were hit by it and their investments decreased in value 
 Here is a short article about the RE price movements in Russia:    So, it seems that when hedge is mostly needed during the time when inflation jumps, RE investments do not protect from it 
 Thank you in advance for your feedback 
 Kind regards, Ilya"

 It is very difficult to find exactly like for like companies in the same industry, going through the exact same growth stage 
 Looking at the players of industries, they may be exposed to large markets, therefore have exposure to more risks, such as currency, political and competition 
 If you take VW for example as a carmaker, the emissions scandal has caused the firm to lose a large chunk in its share price, which was not entirely due to a drop in sales, but more because of all the fines they had to pay. This is not something that could have been compared to other firms with

 What is its meaning 
 The importance of duration comes into play when you look at the risk of bonds, in particular interest rate risk (see the lecture ""Fixed income - government bonds: risks"") 
  When you try to analyze how a given change in interest rate (say 2%) will effectively affect the price of your bond, you find that an interesting quantity comes up: duration 
 Think of it this way: duration is a concept we bother to define and compute because it is key in analyzing the risk of a bond or a bond portfolio 
 Its definition is important so that we compute it correctly 
 But it doesn't have an intrinsic ""meaning"" or ""purpose"" by itself 
 However, it is still very useful 
 By knowing the duration of a bond, we can approximate what will be the change in its price given a particular change in the interest rate 
 By comparing the duration of two bonds, we can identify which of the two will have its price move more when changes in interest rates happen (i.e 
 Which one is more risky) 
  I hope things will get clearer as you progress with the course

 First of all, companies that looks the same and have more-less similar structure, can have different trends and different management 
 Like, company A is constantly growing during last 10 years, they have a stable high-level management team and want to introduce to market new product, and company B is falling down during last 5 years, they change management team 3 months ago, but still the capital and brand is quite power to have the same P/E 
 Or, for example, one of companies with the same P/E finally has an agreement with Chinese government and from the next year will work on this market, and the second company - does not have such 
 So, for now they both looks the same, but opportunities to growth and significantly increase earnings has only first 
 EBITDA rate is also not the best, because EBITDA is the earnings before, for example, amortization, and one of companies has new buildings and this costs is low for them, and other company, with the same EBITDA has 39-years old building of main factory and amortization for them will be more bigger, because of law restrictions to 40-years old buildings, for example 
 Or, one of companies save their money on a deposit of one bank, and other - in Apple and Alphabet shares and interest rate for both of them will be different 
 So, finally, in my opinion, multiples-based valuation method does not touch a lot of details and simplify such things like a management factor, assets of company, etc"

 On the other hand, without the bailout programs, I reckon it would take longer for economy to recover from recessions, thus making it less ""lively"" - extending the periods of stagnation and making the subsequent recovery slower

 2)     \nProvided the banks with bad incentives by\nallowing them to think they that the central bank will again come into the\npicture and save them in case some unfortunate accident occurs

 Geithner, that to send a concrete message initially, they\ndecided that the banks had to solve this problem of 07-09 crash on their own\n& thus they had refused to bail out Lehman Brothers

 They might have to come in the picture again, in case an\naccident arrives in the future which threatens the global economy completely 
 However, as we see after the 07-09 crisis, the US Fed has\nimposed certain protocols for the banks like having adequate capital buffer,\nseparation of investment banking & retail business etc. which in themselves\nare placed to ensure that an activity like 07-09 crisis may not happen again\n& if in case it happens, then the banks are capable enough to shield\nthemselves against it

 To look at the first question, consider what TARP was designed to do 
 Banks could not, therefore, be sure of the financial security of other banks, so were reluctant to lend, locking up financial markets 
 The solution was to approve TARP and use $700 billion to buy up those toxic assets 
 When the toxic assets were replaced by Treasury securities, banks would then have more solid balance sheets and interbank lending would resume 
 We see that the TARP money didn’t prevent the bankruptcies of Chrysler and GM, it just delayed them for six months, and gave the federal government big ownership shares in the bankrupt companies 
 As for the banks, it may be that some of them would have failed without the TARP money, but taking a longer view, that is not a bad thing 
 When firms take risks, they must balance the potential profits from success against the potential losses from failure, and the TARP support removes the last part of that balancing act. There may have been some dislocations in the short run from bank failures, but in the long run allowing them to go under preserves the incentive structure that makes a market economy run. Economics can be unpredictable, and no one can say what the future will bring in an ever-changing world in - especially China and India - can have major impacts on the economy of the U.S 
 But with new regulatory legislation and more vigilant oversight, bailouts of the dollar magnitude that characterized the rescues of 2008 may never again be necessary"

 This might lead to ""incompatibility"" of using the multiples of only one industry 
 Even though they don't diversify, still it's completely misleading to ""generalize"" the companies 
 This thought is even more challenged that companies try to be ahead of its peers (from the same industry) and thus creating significant multiple deviations among them 
 Another robust multiple-based valuation methods is to take an average-over-time multiples of industries or main competitors to avoid the real-time effect of companies that just reported a loss (e.g

 In a free market, even if not completely rational as once believed, capital institutions should be left to the consequences of their irrational lending and made to turn to existing remedies for failing business entities most notably, of course, bankruptcy reorganization or liquidation 
 Bailouts create an artificially stimulated economy 
 This may be good for large beneficiaries of such policies like the so-called ""Too Big To Fail"" banks and investors, but does little to benefit workers or struggling borrowers as the banks have little motivation to lend the easy money to people already saddled with debt 
 Banks see the risk of non-performing loans as outweighing the benefit of increased lending 
 I believe banks that freely make irresponsible, speculative, failed investments that lead to their insolvency absent government bailouts are more accurately ""Too Big To Succeed"" 
  If their activities lead to their failure then I believe the economy would be better off weathering whatever negative impact that brings in the near term because it will lead to healthier functioning institutions filling the vacuum to meet the needs of the broad economy"

 Although the US government intervened through TARP, it was done as a temporary measure since the programme closed down by end of 2014 when all the stake of US Treasury in those banks were sold off. Moving forward, lessons should be drawn from such events and adequate precautionary measures should be taken in order to avoid repetition while bailout should only come as a last resort with conditions attached"

 The outline is that they are willing to make their own assets more valuable which actually worth much much lower if we look at the actual value

 Also, companies may have different strategies (tax planning or to calm the shareholders) about how and when to account earning os losses

 One of the requirements effectively use multiples is to compare companies that actually are comparable - in other words, companies of the same industry or facing the same financial risk 
 However, the multiples do not substitute the valuation analysis 
 There are such situations as when some industry faces a bubble or a company reported losses, there are structural problems to evaluate stocks by multiples

 As more an more institutions were under threat, the risk to the remaining institutions becomes even greater 
 The task at hand was to bring the fire under control 
 This meant saving the banks as they were at the very core of the financial system, and were left 'holding the bag' when it came to providing liquidity to money market funds and asset backed commercial paper conduits that were essential to maintaining efficient credit markets 
 Had the banks not been saved, the losses of investors, pension funds and the entire economy would have been unfathomably large

 Automotive companies for a country) 
  Therefore, price / earnings fails to take into account premiums or discounts for companies with stronger or lower growths, risks involved in achieving this growth or differentials presented by a specific company 
 The political turmoil in Brazil in the recent few years is a good example of a period when shares were undervalued as investors, specially foreign, would require a discount on stocks prices due to risks involved in governmental changes 
 If we consider companies reporting losses, trying to assess fair value based on just price-to-earnings would be impossible (fair value = zero)

 Girardin says the following: If you buy a bond when the initial yield is high, the probability that this year will actually fall over the next five years say, is quite high 
 So it means that, the probability that you will generate good returns with the bonds, and this is the key thing to know, is high 
 Conversely, when bond yields are low, as they are today, there's a very low probability that you will make high  returns if you invest with bonds today 
 Why is that 
 Because the bond yield is low, so the probability that this bond yield will increase overtime is actually quite high 
 And we saw, already by now you should know, what should you know 
 That when bond yields,arise, bond prices fall 
 I strongly believe that Dr 
 Girardin mixes up the use of the words 'Yields' and 'Returns' in the previous two sentences 
 I believe Dr 
 Girardin should have said something consistent with the slide above along the lines of: 'When the initial yield of a bond is high, there's a strong chance that it will continue to produce higher returns since interest rates are likely to fall compared to the current tempting ones that made current bonds attractive 
 On the other hand, bonds with initial low yields imply that current interest rates are low and will most likely increase in the future 
 But we all know that an increase in interest rates will cause the bond yields to fall based on the following formula:  Bond Price= Coupon/(1+YTM) + Principal/(1+YTM)  The higher the Interest rates and lower the price"

 By combining many value drivers into a point estimate, multiples may make it difficult to dis-aggregate the effect of different drivers, such as growth, on value 
 The danger is that this encourages simplistic – and possibly erroneous – interpretation.\n Static: A multiple represents a snapshot of where a firm is at a point in time, but fails to capture the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of business and competition.\n Difficulties in comparisons: Multiples are primarily used to make comparisons of relative value 
 But comparing multiples is an exacting art form, because there are so many reasons that multiples can differ, not all of which relate to true differences in value 
 For example, different accounting policies can result in diverging multiples for otherwise identical operating businesses.\n Dependence on correctly valued peers: The use of multiples only reveals patterns in relative values, not absolute values such as those obtained from discounted cash flow valuations 
 If the peer group as a whole is incorrectly valued (such as may happen during a stock market ""bubble"") then the resulting multiples will also be misvalued.\n Short-term: Multiples are based on historic data or near-term forecasts 
 Valuations based on multiples will therefore fail to capture differences in projected performance over the longer term, and will have difficulty correctly valuing cyclical industries unless somewhat subjective normalization adjustments are made"

 Many companies try to produce goods different from other companies in the same field to gain competitive advantage 
 It may influence compatibility of companies 
 Another problem with multiples-based valuation methods exists if the whole market is under- or overvalues

 The GLD offers much more liquidity and fast return of cash to your portfolio, with little commission cost 
 Owning physical gold has a higher premium ($50 usd over spot price in some case) and it is harder to convert to cash 
 If the  global market was to crash, your physical gold will be worth more than the GLD etf because that runs with the index and a selloff will drag down the GLD eft, and lets not forget the financial institutions that backs those ETF. I don't think we will see such a global crisis which will make holding physical gold or ETF more valuable than owning stocks

 I think all banks knew that it was a one-time thing as soon as they saw the government rejecting Lehman 
 And clearly the support on economic growth was gigantic 
 We can look at Europe and some parts of Asia that suffered from the Mortgage Crisis and they still haven't gotten completely back up with lending still extremely stale despite rates being extremely low. My point being that they aren't even close to the US economy when it comes to y2y growth since the Crisis, and that's because of the loaning of money- which was enabled in the US by the execution of the TARP"

 Consequently, in an environment where broad market indexes suggest overvaluation of equities or technical indicators (e.g 
 Ratio analysis) suggest that Gold could outperform a broader market (e.g 
 S&P 500), one consider an increase in Gold exposure greater than a minimum exposure (e.g 
 5%) 
   The former suggesting an equity-market decline could be on the horizon; or worse yet, a coming black-swan event due to some structural issue in the markets or secular change about to occur.\n \n Other scenarios where commodity prices have begun to move higher in earnest (particularly Crude Oil) often forewarn of coming inflation if price increases are sustained over some period of time (e.g 
 6-months) 
   Said dynamics can give one the opportunity to incrementally increase Gold exposure in anticipation of increased inflation (i.e 
 Increased prices) given upward commodity price pressures.\n \n Alternatively, as inflation abates likely due to central bank intervention (i.e 
 Raising short-term rates) and attendant strengthening in the U.S 
 Dollar that generally follows sustained actions by the Federal Reserve, one would consider reducing Gold exposure incrementally back toward a baseline portfolio amount.\n"

 A firm's performance depends on its investors and management's decisions, which differs from other companies 
 Decisions is what makes a company remain financially solid and be on top of indices, and others be highly sensitive to external agents and news, which makes its share's prices vary over the weeks or even intraday 
 Assuming that another company in the same market or asset class and producing the same goods could help determining the value of a third one, could be misleading, even when we think they are at the same stage of growth, as internal strategies to reduce costs and increase profits take from 3 to 5 or even 7 years to produce results, and that would be the time to evaluate if the direction of two companies are really unfolding in parallel"

  The assumption is that comparable companies tend to converge to the industrie's average ratios on the long run (which can be a wrong assumption sometimes) 
  2 
 There are 3 types of companies where ratio based valuation is difficult:     - firms with negative earnings     - firms with little or no financial history (i.e 
 Startups)     - unique firms with few or no comparable firms 3 
 For companies that have negative earnings the relevant ratios are not applicable 
 There are two cases for firms that just reported a loss:     - for those who reported a loss due to a temporary situation, earnings are assumed to follow the abserved long term trend - earnings are ""normalized"" on the medium term     - for those which face long term problems a more detailed analysis is necessary taking as assumption the earnings of comparable firms or the industry average on the long run"
1989,1592,97,4,2016-07-26 09:18:43,"You would need a substantial part of your portfolio invested in gold to offer an adequate protection against extreme events 
 The opportunity cost of holding a substantial part of your portfolio (30-40% of assets) can become quite staggering if other asset classes perform well 
 Over time, taking into account the compound effect, this can become quite substantial 
 If you decide to move in and out of gold with the hope of minimising the opportunity cost, you end up being subject to market timing which can be positive or negative (as its hard for anyone to predict the future on financial markets) 
  If you do become subject to market timing issues, then I feel gold shows similar limitations to other asset classes such as equities or bonds 
 In the end, gold can look quite tempting, but I would personally really limit its role in my portfolio"
1990,1593,18,4,2016-02-21 15:07:00,"The assumption we make when we use ratios we observe on the market to value other  comparable companies is that these companies are correctly valued in the first place

1993,989,153,4,2016-03-03 02:52:49,"I think when we talk about the insurance, in fact we are referring to how much risk we are willing to take 
 As explained in the videos gold seems to be a very good asset to hedge against the extreme events with some opportunity cost 
 So in other words, Gold can be considered as  a low risk low return investment 
 In the investment philosophy text provided in week 1 of the course, we saw that ""Time""  or the duration of the investment is one of the key factors in formation of an investment philosophy which leads to portfolio creation 
 If an investor aiming for short periods of investment and wants the capital back in short time, I think it is safe to lock a generous portion of the investment in gold 
 For long period investors,  since severe fluctuation  may not seem to be a big  threats as these types of investors can hold on to low market values for a while until the market picks up again placing a large amount of gold in the portfolio does not seem to be a good decision 
 As the conclusion, I think the amount of the gold in the portfolio should be directly correlated to the investment return period an investor desires

 I agree, a practical example would have been nice 
 I think because this is an introductory class, the details for determining valuations were left out due to the complexity 
 However, I'm sure there are resources available if you search around 
 This type of work is done by analysts, so the data may be proprietary since it involves predictions of the future (especially for NPV and DCF) 
   However, the valuation based on comparable firms is fairly accessible 
 You can look up P/E, EBITDA for specific stocks and sectors on sites such as  _domain_  or yahoo finance 
 Furthermore, most financial data for public companies is available through finance websites and the SEC's Edgar database if financial filings 
 Also, many analysts estimates of earnings are publicly available and you could probably extrapolite from that to determine estimated cash flows 
 Here is a link that might help on Valuing Firms Using Present Value of Free Cash Flows:      Frankly, besides valuation on comparable firms, I've only worked with theoretical data so someone else may have more insight or you may be able to find it elsewhere yourself (perhaps in another Coursera course)

 This provides a behavioral explanation of booms and busts and a cognitive ground of business cycles and asset price bubbles and busts, or pricing not reflecting the ""fundamentals"" 
  A positive announcement for a company may trigger irrational overconfidence whereas a semester negative report may also lead to non-rationally explained share price drop

 ""Several valuation methods are available, depending on a company’s industry, its characteristics (for example, whether it is a start-up or a mature company), and the analyst’s preference and expertise 
 In this chapter and the rest of the book, we focus on the mainstream valuation methods 
 These methods are classified into four categories, based on two dimensions 
 The first dimension distinguishes between direct (or absolute) valuation methods and indirect (or relative) valuation methods; the second dimension separates models that rely on cash flows from models that rely on another financial variable, such as sales (revenues), earnings, or book value 
 As their name indicates, direct valuation methods provide a direct estimate of a company’s fundamental value 
 In the case of public companies, the analyst can then compare the company’s fundamental value obtained from that valuation analysis to the company’s market value 
 The company appears fairly valued if its market value is equal to its fundamental value, undervalued if its market value is lower than its fundamental value, and overvalued if its market value is higher than its fundamental value 
 In contrast, relative valuation methods do not provide a direct estimate of a company’s fundamental value: They do not indicate whether a company is fairly priced; they indicate only whether it is fairly priced relative to some benchmark or peer group 
 Because valuing a company using an indirect valuation method requires identifying a group of comparable companies, this approach to valuation is also called the comparables approach

 Hoesli, You've mentioned in the lecture that one of the pros of direct investments in the RE assets is that their returns are not correlated with capital markets movements, while one of the cons of investments into public RE funds is that their returns are correlated with capital markets movements 
 Could you please tell what is the reason for such difference 
 Let's assume that there are 2 identical buildings in the same location - one belongs to private investor, another - to public RE fund 
 In case of downturn on financial markets, shares of public RE fund will most certainly go down with the market 
 How can it be in this case that the value of the building that belongs to private investor, will not go down as well 
 Probably due to the lack of information about the value of that second building (low liquidity) we can't actually see if it's value decreases or not and thus make a suggestion that it is not correlated with the market movement 
 From my point of view, when private owner decides to sell its builing during the market downturn, most probably she will need to offer a sound discount 
 So I can't believe that the correlation is as low as you have mentioned

 The glasses were supposed to represent coupon payments and the large bottle of water at the right was supposed to represent the principal payment for a bond 
 Then he lifted the plank and placed under it a thin piece of wood on which the plank (and cups of water and bottle of water) was balanced 
 The balance point was supposed to represented duration as opposed to maturity which was represented by the bottle (that is, principal payment) 
  The balance point was very close to the end of the plank near the bottle of water right after the fourth glass of water (and not near the center of the plank)

 Maybe 2.5 
 It's not. Well, let's see, maybe what works, what happens 
 Can you hold there

 I'll give you one example, if Greece has a problem and if debt rises relative to GDP. Then there will be more the weight of Greece in the benchmark will increase

2089,1541,30,4,2016-10-21 23:14:39,"""Moral Hazard"" is an consideration that I believe should have been considered morel, particularly in light of Goldman Sachs receiving 100 cents on the dollar from their counterparty exposure to AIG.  This encourages more risk-taking when one of the very parties who was central to mortgage-backed credit default-swaps was Goldman Sachs and AIG.  Thus, Goldman should have taken a hair-cut due to their counterparty risk to AIG.    Moreover--and what often gets overlooked when considering banks that are systemically important--is that if several of these institutions failed (ala Lehman Bros), the void will not remain 
 There will be other, smarter, better managed institutions (or new institutions) that will fill said void 
 This is part of the cleansing process that capitalism provides, if allowed to happen 
 The near-term result is some pain, but the long-term benefits is a healthier set of institutions managed by parties who make more prudent decisions (as opposed to Citi, Goldman, Merrill Lynch, Wachovia, etc to took on too much exposure to mortgage-bond market, while other institutions did not)"
2090,1651,150,4,2016-03-27 21:37:08,"It is also possible to gain some exposure to movements in gold prices via companies with exposure, such as gold mining equities, however the high volatility on these stocks nullifies the rationale for having the original exposure to gold 
 For any investor, in the long-run it does not make sense to have a large proportion of their portfolio in gold as all asset classes should outperform gold over this time horizon 
 In general, investment losses, particularly through capital depreciation, can only be realised if positions are liquidated and therefore if you are a long-term investor (liabilities ignored), you would not need to significantly hedge against losses in a downturn as asset prices are likely to stabilise over time"
2091,1652,240,4,2017-08-22 13:25:12,"I would invest the part of my portfolio in gold which I cannot afford to lose, so that part would be my saving that I cannot put any risk on 
 What I mean is that if I need a certain amount of money for necessities or future necessities, that amount should be saved in the safest way only with consideration to preserve its value against inflation, currency crises, etc. Yes, there would be an opportunity lose, but also some lower financial risks 
 At the end, my philosophy is to invest the money in the safest way by taking smart risks 
 That said, I can only play with the money that I dare to lose 
 Then, I can expect the gains and loses

 If we estimate that in the near future some of these factors may cause the stock market to crash, then I would invest a bigger portion into gold

 This will affect the companies' ratios, and hence these current ratios will not be a good representation of the future's performances

 If the US central bank did not come up with the TARP program, some banks and financial institutions might have survived while some would have to go the way of Lehman Brothers 
 For financial institutions which have survived, shareholders would have suffered losses 
 Arguably, this might have rewarded conservative banks and punished risky banks (and their shareholders) 
  Assuming that only people from the middle class and above held shares in these risky banks, the drop in their networth could reduced income inequality

 10 years have gone, today some may argue the bailout had turned out to be bad incentives, however, i'm not particularly worried about the potential concequences but do admit that central banks have to create more tools/weapons to combat the slowed economy globally

 In the past periods of ecoonmic growth we may find a lot of examples when multiple-based valuation was not appropriate 
 For instance, when IT cmpanies recovered after the  _domain_  crisis, each of them had own path of restructuring and, thus, could not be compared to its competitor 
 Another example deals with innovations 
 When there are two firms which are on a similar stage of development, and one of them applies touch-screen technology, but another refuses from that 
 Consequently, we may assume different rate of growth of the innovtor in the future and, thus, cannot compare it to its rival"
2136,1681,108,4,2016-05-28 21:58:16,"The assumption is that the companies are in fact similar enough to be good reference points for each other 
 We need to keep in mind that each company, no matter how similar at first glance, are unique in that they are run by different management team, offer slightly different niche in the market, and at somewhat different stage in their life 
 For example, both Google and Yahoo are search engine companies but their earnings and outlooks are very different"
2137,1682,15,4,2016-04-01 20:46:12,"Companies which are in the same industry, same stage of development, and have similar financial structures (companies you think might be comparable) might be grossly over or undervalued at the time

 If there's a young couple they are likely to invest more in such assets as stocks, bonds, as they have many ambitious and time-sensitive goals 
 From an older couple of retired people I expect more cautious approach, when they would invest significant part in gold, currencies or bonds, and less in stocks with maximum return for example 
 As for me, a person in mid 30-ty, I would invest in gold 1/4 of my portfolio

 As such, investors that engage in these markets already accept the high threshold for potential profits and losses 
 Equities are offensive investments 
 Gold on the other hand is defensive 
 By disproportionately allocating a large portion of your portfolio to gold, you reduce the growth potential of your portfolio 
 An investor is better off diversifying his/her portfolio to a variety of asset classes rather than gearing up on one specific asset class in anticipation of adverse market conditions 
 Given time, the positive returns from a well balanced portfolio can buffer against abrupt adverse market conditions that may erode earnings 
 This will allow an investor to re-organize the portfolio and switch to defensive investment instruments (like gold) to weather the storm 
 As such, having some gold as part of a well diversified portfolio is prudent but having a gold intensive portfolio is ill advised"

 Then the Govt introduced the TARP to bail out the economy and to address the subprime mortgage crisis 
 It was introduced to buy out the assets to increase the liquidity in the markets 
 Later on it was modified to buy equity stake in the these banks by the govt or fed reserve 
 It was absolutely necessary at that point as the economy had gone into complete crisis 
 It initially gave the treasury $700 billion to buy Mortgage backed securities from the banks and in the process create liquidity in the money markets 
 The rules of TARP placed certain restrictions on the tax benefits and placed restrictions on the salaries of the executives and bonuses 
 The govt claimed that it prevented auto industry from failing and saved 1 million jobs helped stabilize banks and increased credit availability for individuals and businesses 
 However, The TARP program is estimated to cost taxpayers about $32 billion, much less than the OMB's report that estimated $63 billion 
 This is largely because the CBO projects a lower cost for the mortgage programs

 What troubles me though is that indeed the actions of the Central Banks have saved the system but that was in expectation that governments would also do their bit and would fix their actions (government debt), which they have not so far. So I fear now that what the CBs did was (or will be become vain) as the ""culprits"" have continued and we are now in a more difficult situation and CBs have no more ""fire power""

 To put it more simply there is a difference between the local market and the local financial market due to the concreteness of the product 
 I am not talking about derivatives 
 If I buy agricultural products I will have more transparency, information etc because I am more likely to actually establish face to face relationships with suppliers 
 It would be absurd to picture a rosy picture on an auction or any place where the product does not deliver expectations 
 At such situations tradition is the best way to deal 
 But for derivatives where the connection between the underlying commodity if often not of interest; the relationship is harmed/reduced 
 The relationship is more and more reduced to price movements (volatility) 
  So depending on where the commodity sits in the spectrum of markets huge profits and losses are only made in the abstracted away products shifting the commodity returns from the third quadrant to the fourth 
 Like the difference between the cab driver (commodity physical product) and Uber (abstracted product)

 Thus, it is extremely important to act with precaution when assessing companies that we judge being integrated in the same market or complementing a group.\n For all those reasons, I presume that the assumption would be the analysis of features that a company combine on all your structure, i.e: costs, share, strategies, accounting policies, management capacity, products, etc. In Brazil's current moment (2015-16) utilize the multiple-based as the only method of valuing a company would not be recommended at all. Companies such as Petrobrás S.A and Vale S.A, which during many years have been presenting excellent performances are now facing a different type of crisis 
 Those companies have been on the spot since the last year, and many problems are emerging every day, mostly of them originated because of their involvement with government corruption 
 So, I imagine that the multiple-based method would perform a better job if combined with other methods of valuation 
 In the case of a company that reports a negative earning, we have to observe if those losses are being constantly presented in the company's sheet 
 If this condition is true, I also imagine that the simple use of multiple-based method would not be a good choice 
 If not, the method should be combined with any other enterprise valuation mechanism"

  We also assume that the conditions that lead to these multiples are also going to be the same conditions going forward 
 This can lead to problems with companies that report a loss, as the loss could be a one time event 
 However, using multiple valuation you could be inclined to disregard investing in this company due to an unflattering multiple 
 Multiple based valuation becomes risky during bubbles such as the tech bubble in the early 2000's

 The price is equal to the future cash flows (coupons plus final principal) discounted at the YTM.  So, when the YTM goes up, you are discounting more and that yields a lower price because the future cash flows are unchanged 
 Note that when you are at maturity (i.e 
 T=0), then it no longer matters what the YTM is because there is no time left 
 The price is unaffected and equals the return of principal plus the last coupon"

 (c) P/E ratio might misleading based on how that ratio is obtained 
 For an example: if a company holds a lot of excess cash, which generate little or no income, that ratio may show an artificially inflated value 
 Therefore all non-operating assets must be excluded in obtaining the ratio 
 (d) multiple based valuation based on industry averages doesn't take into account that different companies, although in the same industry, may have different growth expectations based on the value they create"
2367,246,509,4,2016-10-30 19:38:19,"According to me, risk is the probality to have a return which is different of what was expected from an investment for example 
 We are going to talk about risk when the futur is incertain 
 In order to have the possibility to measure the risk, it should be important to first identify the kind of risks which can affect the investment 
 Therefore you should find out couple of information about the investment such as :  - where are you going to invest in (shares, bonds, 
 )  
   - When would you like to get your return on investment (Short term, medium or long term)  
   - Would you like to invest in the same basket

 In this regard, since full understanding of each company's operational activities, financial scores and market results is virtually impossible, one has to make certain assumptions to fill in knowledge gaps among similar firms' performance factors, or even offer generalizations just in order to force-compare firms along specific business dimensions 
 In essence, for the multiples-based approach to work, we make the assumption that all the firms being compared share the same revenue drivers and are priced accordingly"

 If it happens next week you will be partly covered, but if it happens in ten years time I don't think you will be still around with the poor returns you would be getting (in case you are managing a portfolio for your clients)

 As we have learnt, stimulating a recovery / growth is much harder than cooling down the economy, the drastic measures were required to provide confidence to the markets or otherwise, it would have been much harder to claw our way out of a major crisis 
 While we recognize that some of the measures have not been rolled back, especially the unprecedented and historically low interest rate environment, I believe the central banks are waiting for the economy to stand on a stronger footing and then act to gradually increase interest rates 
 We are seeing excess and some bubbles in the equities and property markets but it is easier, as we have learnt in this course, to cool down the economy by increasing interest rates, regulating certain 'excess/bubble' sectors, restricting money flow and/or reducing/tweaking fiscal spending / policies moving forward when the economy is standing on sound footing 
 There are efforts already taken by Governments around world to specifically assist to cool down certain sectors (especially the property sector) and implement stress tests and related banking regulations to ensure Banks are on sound footing

 Did the US Gov't ensure that once the situation was stabilized they placed reforms in the financial markets so that this would not happen again

 But in so doing, some argue that the government actually incentivized banks to be careless in their investment activity in the future since they can expect the government to bail them out if things go wrong because of their undeniable vital role in the functioning of the economy

 For example in 1999 they highly value Telecom stocks (Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom.

 1 
 When an entire industry is overvalued 
 This leads to multiples that are inaccurate 
 For example in the tech bubble in the early 2000s 
 Tech companies were all overvalued and hence multiples based valuation would give inaccurate valuations 
 2 
 When a company straddles two industries 
 For example uber 
 It is diifculy to place it in one particular industry 
 As it is part of the tech industry as well as the transportation industry 
 Choosing multiplies exclusively from one industry would lead to an inaccurate valuation of this company 
 In such scenarios the multiples based valuation will not work accurately 
 3 
 Multiples based valuation methods tend to ignore the unique characteristics of companies 
 For example their competitive advantage, management teams etc. These unique characteristics could make a company perform better or worse than the companies that their multiples are based off. Hence this would lead to inaccurate valuation of a company 
 4 
 Companies that have disruptive products and disruptive business models 
 Tend to outperform companies similar to them exponentially 
 Hence companies that are disruptive cannot be valued using a generic multiple based of comparable companies in a particular industry"

 It's also assumed that other companies are fairly priced which might not be the case 
 As multiplied negative values would still remain negative this method probably has to be amended 
 E/g

2567,1934,655,4,2017-07-21 02:55:38,"I just learned from the lecture that if you own a fixed interest government bond, and market interest rates for that instrument change, the value of your bond changes in proportion to the duration (D) of your bond 
 That bothers me though 
 If you have a very long term bond - say one that returns your principal to you in 30 years - that suggests that when market interest rates increase a tiny bit, the value of your bond will drop precipitously 
 But wait - being in it for the long term (like 30 years) suggests that there will be fluctuations 
 I understand that when the market turns the other way the value of your bond will similarly rise in a profound way according to the same formula, but that seems like the wrong result 
 Shouldn't the value immediately after there is a minor fluctuation in the market interest rate reflect the fact that there will be ups and downs over the extended period until maturity and that it will all likely average out?  Shouldn't the NPV of the bond, i.e 
 The value of your bond, be relatively stable for a long term bond as a result, rather than wildly gyrating 
 What am I missing here"

 However, that must not always be the case 
 First of all, its very difficult to find comparable companies, that is companies with similar financial structures, and secondly even if we find one, that does not mean that the market is correctly valuing that company 
 In other words, main disadvantages of using multiples are the fact that the market does not always correctly values the peer group, and determining the appropriate multiple to use for a given company can be highly subjective as truly comparable companies rarely exists 
 When it comes to companies with negative earnings P/E ratio isn't meaningful 
 EV/sales ratio is a ratio that companies with negative earnings use"

As the all other companies would have a high P/E it would give a high value for the observerd company as well regardless of the real value of the company 
 In case of negativ earnings it would just give a negative value for the company value so it cant be used"

2582,1944,341,4,2018-07-29 02:40:09,"There are several factors that have an impact on my answer 
 The first is the age of the investor and their investment horizon 
 In my youth I was heavily weighted toward domestic and international equities 
 My thought was that I didn't need the money for 30 years and recoveries always follow crashes 
 In fact, I didn't hold gold as a hedge because I kept cash on the side as I became nervous about bubbles and invested that cash after a precipitous loss 
 Now, my investment horizon is shorter and I have moved more money towards bonds 
 I think that I should hold a small amount of my assets as gold 
 If there were a black swan event, the gold could provide a small amount of balance in my portfolio 
 In the long term, 10-20 years, equities seem to generally outperform gold, so I wouldn't want to be too heavily invested in gold 
 If I was in a less stable country, I might be more inclined to invest in gold"
2583,180,150,4,2016-03-27 15:38:38,"Gold should only be a small part of the portfolio, perhaps 5-10% 
  Any more than that can cause large opportunity costs

 The effects of such incentives are really bad. Firstly, the banks are rewarded for improper credit assessment and they continue their practices to get further uncontrolled growth 
 Next, the borrower behavior also changes and they expect a similar bailout in case of repeated default 
 Those who repay loans on time start believing that they are fools because the amount would have been written off and those who believe in saving and not borrowing start believing that they are living in an incongruous world

 The denominator in the formula you provided discounts this Terminal Value back to its value today 
 So basically, Philip's formula gave you the (value of the) Terminal Value at the end of the of the explicit forecasting horizon (i.e 
 In the future) while the formula here gives you the (value of the) Terminal Value today 
 This is why in Philip's example of firm valuation, the Terminal Value (equal to 1742 in 2020) has to be discounted along with the free cash flow forecast in 2020 in order to get its value today 
 To summarize, the formula you provided here gives the present value of the Terminal Value 
 I hope this helps

 There also remains the risk that the multiples approach is too simplistic to capture the relevant idiosyncrasies of the company or industry which make it a good/bad bet. This last point is the converse of the risk of inaccuracy on account of using too many assumptions to get a more precise (though possibly more incorrect) valuation using NPV.

 I wouldn't feel comfortable using the multiple-based valuation in times of crisis, or even when inovations bring an alarming growth to a company, these are times of instability and the companies might be over/undervaluated 
 The fact that a company reported a loss alone doesn't invalidate the comparison, as it could be due to a factor that affects an entire acting field in the economy, so the reasons why it reported a loss should be studied before using it to compare to other companies"

 I would think that at any point when there is a significant movement in the market (ie, a ""step function""), it would not be possible to use multiple-based valuations as the response by each company to the shift in the environment is likely to be drastically different 
 The ""step function"" could also be introduced due to the introduction of a technology, business process, etc that is vastly different than what was known before 
 For example, the introduction of the iPhone likely made it impossible to evaluate Apple 
 But now that most companies have produced a smartphone, the multiples-based valuation method can now be applied

2660,1990,218,4,2016-06-18 03:10:19,"It depends on your financial goals 
 Lets suppose you want to want to have significantly high returns from your investments 
 This means taking more risk in order to achieve your goal 
 Thus I would invest a large portion of the available capital in gold to use it as a back-up to mitigate potential losses from other investments so that I have capital to invest in the future to retrieve those losses, or at least a percentage of it 
 If you want to take a conservative approach, I would recommend holding from 15% to 20% of gold in your porfolio 
 Many may thing having a 20% in your porfolio is excessive, but during a ""black swan"", it can mitigate the losses substantially 
 In my opinion, better safe than sorry 
 Now let's suppose you want a porfolio with moderate return rates and risk 
 You aren't particularly interested in earning very high amounts of money from your investments 
 You prefer moderate/low returns with considerably low risk by holding, for example, a high percentage of AAA bonds in your porfolio 
 In this escenario, I would recommend holding from 10% to 15% of gold since you still need some kind of insurance 
 If you are a paranoid, though, and you are worried about possible economic downturns or ""black swans,"" you may want to hold 20% of gold, possibly more 
 During the financial global crisis we saw how CDOs, even the safest, lost their value and caused billionaire losses to banks and other financial institutions 
 Therefore gold, in case of recession, can back you up against it to a degree, so it is wise to have a big portion of your porfolio in gold in a situation like that 
 And as we saw in this week's lessons, it is better to invest in gold when the economy is stable and its price is relatively low because it's price will raise excessively during an economic downturn

 For example, the P/E ratio is a common measure to value shares\nof companies from various economic sectors 
 Despite its prevalence, this\nindicator has disadvantages 
 Firstly, it is not applicable to corporations with\nnegative net profits, that is, unprofitable 
 There is one more important point.\nP/E does not consider the difference in taxation and debt burden (capital\nstructure) of the compared companies 
 It turns out that two enterprises can\nlook different from the P/E point of view, precisely because of differences in\nthese aspects of business 
 The fact, that P/E ratio of companies which are compared\nstrongly differs, is not a reason to conclude an underestimation of one of\nthem 
 According to McKinsey&Company, multiples can often mislead the investors:\n“Investors have different expectations about each company’s ability to create\nvalue going forward, so not every hard-lines retailer is truly comparable” (Goedhart,\n Koller, & Wessels, 2005) 
  Often, the P/E\nratio is most appropriate for analyzing bank shares 
 Therefore, it is not\nrational to use multiples-based valuation methods in each case 
 The firm with negative\nearnings is very difficult to assess 
 It is impossible to determine or use the\ngrowth rate of profit 
 When the company reported a loss, the use of growth\nrates makes the loss even bigger 
 An alternative approach to assess the profit\ngrowth is to use analytical estimates of the future growth in profits,\nespecially over the next five years 
 However, such estimate is not meaningful for\nfirms with losses

2720,1897,389,4,2017-07-31 04:41:20,"The main assumption when we use ratios is that companies trade at fair value in the short term, and that is far away from the reality 
 There are other aspects that might affect the stock price and the performance of them like managerial skills and ethics, the probable market speculations and other external facts that affect stock price 
 Another important assumption is that past earnings and performances don`t show a reality in which firms could perform 
 Investors don't have a record of how the firm performed in the past and risk their capital when they not take that into account 
 The subprime crisis could be a good example of an instance in history where a mutiple based valuation method would have been inaccurate 
 The previous years of the crisis showed very good assets performances when the reality was really dangerous and uncertain 
 Earnings were very nominal and managed out of the market reality 
 Companies that report losses usually have a bad performance at the stock market, and a multiples based valuation methods will support that assumption 
 However, investors have an opportunity when the stock prices perform wrong and some will buy in order to get benefits when the stocks perform better in the future"

 Of course, it is a very subjective decision about how much to put in gold 
 My guess would be to have 15-20% in the beginning of 2019, and increase is as I become acquianted with the definite harbingers of the upcoming turmoil (maybe even up to 40-50%)

 At best having 50% of your portfolio in gold in the event of a black swan event may only serve to dull the pain of the losses that may have been experienced rather than compensate you.  However, in a detailed look of the material provided it would seem that with a longer term view the falls tend to rectify themselves (somewhat) over the following year or years 
 However, time is an important factor here 
 As for the price of gold itself, like any investment traded in a market place it carries risk and that is something that really was not looked at in any of the videos 
 Had you bought in August 2011 it was $1750 per ounce 
 Today it is $1280 per ounce so as a straight investment that has been pretty poor 
 Likewise as a hedge it has not been so good either over that period

 On the other hand, as suggested by Niall Ferguson in his ""The great degeneration"" the lack of criminal/civil accountability of the people (managers) responsible for creating such a crisis is the real bad incentive for banks, as they profited millions during the bubble and did not have to suffer the consequences of their irresponsible management decisions (which were suffered by society as whole on their behalf)"

 I think bailing out rightfully helps the banks to serve their purpose in the economy 
 Bottom line is without banks, economy will not grow 
 However, banks' engagement in businesses that may run into high risk of having Troubled Assets (TA) needs to be controlled and regulated by regulatory organizations 
 In case of US, as far as I am aware, weak and fragmented regulations lead the banking system into trouble 
 I live in Canada and I know Canadian banks are tightly regulated based on risk evaluation, market saturation, etc. That is to say banks simply do start any new investment in highly competitive and already saturated sectors such as retail 
 In an evidence, Canadian banking system did not experience any of the trouble US banking systems have suffered from

 However the choice of a multiple is subjective and in my opinion based on gut feeling 
 It is not a bad thing per se, experienced industry specialists can ballpark it more accurately 
 2) In periods of high volatility such as bubble bursts, the market is overwhelmed by a severe lack of trust from its stakeholders 
 Multiples can drastically vary from one day to the other or even worse, from one hour to another 
 I guess during the 2001 dotcom crisis, multiples-based valuation methods were not an effective tool to value companies present in the internet industry 
 3) Firms that just reported a loss can either be considered as an outlier and therefore be excluded from the equation 
 Or, an investor can look at the average ratio displayed by the firm 
 In my opinion, further analysis of the cash flows of a loss making company are needed 
 Reclassification of cash flows can often change the investment decision from a 'no' to a 'yes' 
  For example, if a company has accelerated the depreciation of its assets, it is possible that it also reported a loss 
 Another thing to consider is the eventuality of rapid and agressive expansion strategy of a company which would typically result in negative earnings"

  In my mind, the answer is decidedly “no” 
  The financial turmoil, loss of savings and inability to finance day-today operations of businesses that would follow such a collapse, would heavily outweigh the admittedly morally gray zone of saving a financial sector that has overextended its reach.\n Simply put, it would not have been the wealthiest that would have suffered the most 
 It would have been people of low income and small businesses that would in one day end up with absolutely nothing and furthermore and perhaps worse, faced with the complete inability to receive any credit for the foreseeable future; not because they were completely unworthy of it but because there simply wouldn’t be enough of a financial system left to lend them any.\n So, while the solution was not perfect or morally unimpeachable, it was a necessary and (all things considered) cost-effective way of keeping the maximum possible amount of credit available to the market

 Of course they did. However, they would have suffered more if the alternative had been chosen"

 I am not sure about the conditions for TARP, but in least in Sweden, the bank bailouts included nationalizing parts of the banks (i.e

 That said, I wonder if there is a more proactive approach to crises like this 
 For instance, wouldn't it have been easier (and better) to have had a little oversight and regulation to avoid the manipulations and terrible financial instruments that caused the crash in the first place, as opposed to trying to pick up all the pieces once we are stuck in that terrible place to trying to heat up the economy (noting that we've just learned this can be very hard to do)"

 There is of course the worry that banks may feel in a certain way protected, with always a plan B in case things go wrong, in case actions taken from rogue and distracted employees would go too far; investments banks and above all rating agencies might not feel the overheating sensation that someone may feel when feeling completely responsible about what they are doing, because in the back of their head there will always be now the big plan B, the government, playing the role of the lovely parents that would help you ad support you even when you're wrong, keeping their children infantile 
 But the thing is that here we are not talking about children, we are talking about adults, grown ups that should now play the role of the parents, protecting and taking care of their clients and customers that without they would be jobless and moneyless as well 
 I'm sure that the US government would have probably came up with a better plan if it only had more time to evaluate and think about the situation; but there was the too urgent need to bail out those banks that held million of people's money, an eventual not taking action of the US government would have probably caused something close to the end of capitalism, the end of order, but in a too bad way, in a way recalling the 1929 great depression, and that may even have been the fair epilogue, but certainly not the most pleasurable"

2953,2165,266,4,2016-08-03 21:24:06,Negative short term earnings could be used if high future growth potential
2954,2166,699,4,2016-04-12 09:59:06,"Well, in easy terms it's about influencing market participants behaviour 
 By increasing interest rates, cost of capital increases 
 Individuals tend to save more or getting confrontated with higher credit costs and therefore taking less credits (i.e 
 Think about higher mortgage rates or leasing rates) 
  Industrials have to focus higher financing costs, project plannings becoming tighter etc. 
    
 Expected outcome is a slow down in economic activities with the assumption of a more competitive market environment and prices to decline 
 Hence official rates influencing various market rates, asset prices, FX rates and all corresponding expectations with the aim to influence demand in general 
 As a live opposite example you can take the examined QE which dumped rates event to negative territory to stimulate economic activities and creating a nasty environment for savings."

 If the portfolio contains\nmainly EM assets, then more importance should be given to gold as more black\nswans or dangerous events would be more likely to be expected 
 Less importance\nshould be given if only invested in DMs. Furthermore, if you are trying to hedge against gold, other\ninvestments such as TIPS are possible 
 I think that these would also overcome\nthe opportunity cost associated with old as you would earn a return which is\nnot eroded by inflation 
 Either way, I believe a 5% allocation to gold or less is\nnecessary

 We would assume that such ratios of comparable companies would be compatible but not correct

 This method could be useful in applying to comparable companies in a similar industry"

 As many will note, there were still several incidents where banks were fined for their employee's involvement in insider trading and market manipulation 
 There was no lesson to be learned from the bailout in many cases 
 However there is an apparent impact on the stricter regulations and governing by FINRA but as we all are noting, there is still no impact on the upside of the economy 
 There is a business as usual response and that response may be due to the fact that financial institutions feel assured that should another crisis develop, the US government will have less of a choice to bail them out.  Ultimately, banks will comply with all the rules and regulations but regardless of outcome will not suffer with the knowledge that someone is there to cushion the fall"

 On a second thought, if the black swan occurs then would the buyers of your gold know that you are desperate to trade it for items that hold more value: food, water etc. Or would you trade it for the same dollar that is losing it's value 
 And what about silver 
 Isn't that a poor man's gold 
 Would silver owners be able to trade it more easily in such events as black swan

  In the circumstance where a company has just reported a loss, we can use multiples other than P/E ratio, such as enterprise value/EBITDA (though it would be important to determine whether the company was likely to return to profitability, as in the case of company in a cyclical industry, for example, or whether the losses were likely to continue)"

 Though there are arguments about the effects of such unconventional policies on the future of the economy it is important to note that extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures and in the long run by avoiding a great depression type of recession the US is better positioned to deal with future crisis

 This was essentially a reflection of lack of liquidity and/or negative investor sentiment 
 At such times, the multiples would not be a true reflection of the value of these companies / shareholder equity value, as the markets would have grossly undervalued these companies, and hence investment opportunities could have been missed 
 Companies that report losses are either at early stage or growth stage, or have massive capital improvement projects 
 As a result, using appropriate ratios for such companies is more critical in order to ascertain a fair value for these companies

 Another assumption is that the other company is representative of the copany we want to evaluate

3074,2225,329,4,2018-04-11 19:26:29,"It is difficult to isolate and quantify the net effect of the government bailouts 
 However, there is some evidence indicating that the bailouts helped revive the economy 
 In this case, the bailout may have had a net positive effect 
 The question as to whether this bailout will incentivize banks to act carelessly is worth exploring 
 On the one hand, although some organizations did receive massive bailouts, it is important to note that the burst of the housing bubble had already severely damaged or destroyed several companies, portfolios, and communities 
 Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., as an example, is a bank that survived the Great Depression and then collapsed following the bubble - even the legendary survivors are not immune to catastrophe 
 As another example, Merrill Lynch & Co 
 Inc. was forced to be acquired by the Bank of America in order to continue to survive 
 In both of these cases, many major players in the banking industry fell and permanently lost their wealth and careers 
 This decimation may have served as a reminder and bitter lesson to bankers and investors (before the bailouts, there was a lot of uncertainty as to who would make it through) 
  So it is perhaps inappropriate to say that the banks came out unscathed 
 On the other hand, the possibility of a bailout, no matter how remote, may act as a form of false insurance in the minds of bankers 
 Therefore, they can underestimate risk or even justify its disregard in the name of short term gains and performance (which is a key driver in competitive fields such as finance and banking) 
  Perhaps an enhanced solution to the bailouts could have included severe penalties to key players (such legal prosecution or personal fines) in order to deter future irrationally risky behaviour 
 Another possibility would have been offering the bailouts only if certain conditions were met, such as the termination of certain employees, a reduction in total compensation for board members and C-suite executives, and/or the mandatory permanent dismissal of current board members and C-suite executives (i.e 
 They cannot be re-elected or appointed) 
  Some might argue that such sanctions would constitute government interference with the private sector and as such should be immediately dismissed 
 Although the premise is correct (that such sanctions are essentially government interference), it should be noted that government bailouts are also a form of government interference and as such, any proponents of the bailouts cannot rationally dismiss the idea of sanctions purely based on the notion of avoiding government interference 
 That is not to say that such sanctions should be automatically adopted alongside a bailout; rather, there needs to be a rational argument based on factual premise and thorough analysis against or for a potential course of action 
 Another measure that could accompany a bailout is developing something similar to the EPA's Superfund, which was collectively funded by major players in the oil and gas industry in order to allocate government funding for managing environmental liabilities that cannot be funded by the parties responsible 
 This fund essentially is a form of government insurance against environmental risks 
 Whether such a system has a place in modern banking is debatable 
 One final consideration is Hyman Minsky's prediction of boom and bust cycles 
 At its most basic level, his theory is that boom and bust cycles are a natural part of the capitalist economy 
 In essence, a bust (or burst of a bubble) causes bankers, investors, and governments to behave more rationally and to better account for risks 
 In some cases, it is even argued that for a number of years following a bust, stakeholders are overly cautious in their assessments of risk 
 However, as the economy begins to prosper, the reign of rationality begins to erode and make way for irrational optimism and speculation 
 In aggregate terms, the market reaches a point of instability, in which the previous upward momentum is overpowered by the effects of irrational exuberance, and then collapses as fear takes over and investors lose confidence 
 The cycle then repeats itself 
 With this consideration in mind, it is possible that history would have repeated itself, in some form or another, regardless of the bailouts - simply due to human nature.\n\n To synthesize an answer to the original question based on the above information is not a simple task 
 In essence, I think that if the net effect (in net present value terms; NPV) of the bailout was positive, then  by all means, it is a rational course of action 
 The first problem comes when determining the actual net benefit based on how this bailout will affect bankers' perception of risk in the future 
 This variable is highly unknown and impossible to determine objectively with absolute certainty 
 The second problem is perhaps the issue of imposing sanctions or taking punitive action against the key players in the banking industry, whether they were bankers or credit rating agencies 
 This again is a difficult question to answer; however, I think it is still important to consider this alternative in NPV terms as to whether it may deter future reckless behaviour 
 Again, quantifying this variable would be difficult 
 Perhaps an approach that I would find most favourable is an analysis (albeit imperfect) showing the rationale for the decision to impose a bailout (with or without sanctions) and its expected net benefit to the national economy in the long run. Such an analysis should clearly state its assumptions and be open for public scrutiny by academics and (disinterested) professionals 
 Although this analysis may not be a perfect representation of reality, it is nonetheless important to attempt to quantify the potential benefits, costs, and risks of any course of action involving such a large sum of money"

 One instance where using P/E would have been extra dangerous was during the dot-com bubble of 99-01, where companies were trading at 75x P/E (where today it hovers ~20) 
  There were no sound fundamentals for valuation when looking at actual revenue being produced by these companies, and comparing that to the exorbitantly speculative share prices tech companies were trading at during those times

 On the other hand, it created dangerous precedence by condoning and possibly incentivizing ineptitude on part of the largest financial institutions in the US

3151,2268,307,4,2016-11-11 13:36:13,"DCF is long and tedious, and ratios are quick and dirty 
 I initially learned to use ratios as a ballpark figure 
 Like looking at 989 x 32  
  it's close enough to 1000 x 30 = 30,000  
  so I can do a quick calculation and my intuition says to investigate if I get something very different 
 If you are going to use ratios, take some extra time to look at a few. When we use ratios such as P/E, we assume the components are appropriate measures for evaluating the company 
 This may not be the situation though for P/E in early growth companies or restructurings, where they may not have profit but they do have value; in these situations, may be required to use other ratios, such as cashflows or forward looking earnings 
 Likewise, we also assume the components are fairly measured and market information is priced in 
 However, ""earnings"" may be massaged and contain their own assumptions, or derive from one time events and not solely operations; the quality of earnings must be known 
 Additionally, we may have earnings and profits, but increasing account receivables that may soon lead to cashflow problems 
 Finally, CAPM and P/E are looking at past performance, but we are all familiar with ""past performance does not guarantee future results.""  P/E is looking at the trailing months, but we need to know if the situation has changed for the future 
 As such, a low P/E may not be a bargain, but in fact a sign that investor's have lost confidence 
 This may be especially prevalent when the market as a whole is reeling (such as the savings-loan, dot-com, or financial crisis); while an undervalued stock will still have a low P/E, it will be mixed in with poor performers and it will be worth doing the extra homework to be assured of your investment's positioning"

 Modern economies need banks to lend if they are to function 
 As we saw quite clearly when they don't the whole system ceases up and becomes dysfunctional 
 On the down side it does create future bad behaviour as the same players are back in business and currently with demand outstripping supply, property is once again booming and banks are eager to lend

3164,2273,19,4,2016-05-02 00:28:17,"Not that much, since the US government has also been working very diligent in coming up with rules, regulations and laws to regulate the financial institutions in order to prevent unscrupulous risk taking activities which lead to the 2008 financial crisis"
3165,2274,192,4,2016-08-10 20:35:15,"The whole problem is not of banks 
 Government policies and capital economic system should also shoulder the responsibility 
 Of course, to certain percentage the inefficient performance fo the banks will add up to the problem 
 Now, coming to the bail-out policy 
 There can be some situations where in without bailing out there cannot any economic stimulation 
 But, at the same time, bailing out might create an attitude in the banks to act leniently in future 
 So, the solution: We need to bailout the banks on case-to-case basis, and on the points earned by laying out certain criteria 
 Further, the conformance to the critieria should be identified through proper auditing procedures specially prepared for the situation in demand as the case, scenario, circumstances that are vital and inevitable evil for the current consequence 
 Added to the procedure, identifying the criteria, preparing framework for auditing, and proper decision on case to case basis, the whole process is to be analysed thoroughly by experts and eventually to be made public, thus obtaining transperancy and publlic acceptance 
 This will    encourage the banks come out of the difficult times   and at the same time banks will be determined to act prudently in future   stimulates the slowing economy in future   eases the public / corporations from difficult times and re-engage them in economic activity 
 Out of the box thinking: It is always better to avoid the problem, than solving it 
 Here, the main problem is cyclic nature of the economic system, an inherent part and a necessary evil of the capital economic system 
 If some how, the system can take care of the production and competition by regulating them as per the demand, thus avoid cut-throat price competition, over production, leading to high supply - low demand periodically, while accumulating wealth at concentrated pockets leaving bottom without any clue to come out of it

 The technological sector of the market had become particularly severely overvalued due to investor sentiment being clouded by the euphoria of seemingly endless gains in any company purporting to be a ""ground floor opportunity"" in the emerging dot,com space 
 That said, the dot-com bubble was different from other historical irrational market overvaluations such as the Dutch Tulip bubble, in that the internet during the turn of the millennium was still quite a burgeoning technology of unknown potential thus making any projections of the valuation of otherwise seemingly viable companies especially difficult 
 The current P/E ratio becomes useless when a company reports negative earnings 
 Negative earnings, however, are not necessarily indicative of a companies overall health or potential for future success

 A banker who knows that his or her bad decisions could lead to the bank's failure will recognize he or she has some skin in the game, whether it be a pension plan, executive stock options, continued employment, or professional reputation 
 Remove enough of this risk of failure thus increases the odds of greater risk-taking by the bankers (hence the banks) in the future 
 Moreover, programs such as TARP penalized good actors in two ways 
 First, it kept afloat competitors whose employees had made bad decisions and thus hindered the natural ability of markets to reward those who make good decisions and punish those who make bad decisions 
 Bankruptcy is analogous to allowing natural forest fires to periodically clear out the underbrush: if you suppress all forest first, the deadwood and underbrush accumulates and, when a fire inevitably breaks out, it is far more catastrophic 
 Second, TARP deliberately forced many sound financial institutions to participate, thus given political cover for helping out failing institutions

3266,1541,732,4,2016-10-02 01:12:36,"Steady, positive returns suggest a lack of variability 
 Consequently, this suggests lower risk 
 To answer your question:  No, the method of calculating risk was not specifically discussed--only a measure of risk in percentage terms (already calculated) 
   The measure of risk that is used, generally, is the standard deviation of returns 
 To your second question, variability of returns (and thus risk) do NOT have to be negative necessarily to suggest risk when examining variability 
 That's where looking at skewness helps better describe the returns (putting them in context) 
   Clearly, unexpectedly large positive returns are good, but this also contributes to the variability calculation (by increasing it) 
   Thus, solely interpreting higher variability of returns as more risky may be premature if the returns are positively skewed (to the right)

 If this way was perfect, why people needed to find other ways 
 A company can report a loss but if they have current/long term assets, these will create value for them 
 If that value can compensate their current/long term liabilities we can still say that company may create value for its current and future shareholders"

 Whereas using DCF, we concentrate on the company's uniqueness in its business 
 Two companies may look similar, but there are other variables at play as well, most notably their business models

 Low cost carrier airlines can be at the same stage of growth serving the same category of customers

 Although is probable that you find similar companies, it is impossible that 2 companies are exact same 
 They have different managers, strategies, operational challenges, so twhat you really are doing is putting 2 companies and assuming they are exact same 
 I rarely use P/E ratio to compare companies, although can be an indicator for a segment of market, i.e 
 Companies that work on oil business, often has a P/E ratio of XX.X

 However, in some instances, this could result in a drastic underestimation or overestimation of a company 
 For example, lets assume grocery companies were private and the data of their valuation was not publicly presented 
 If we were valuing ""Sears"" we would use a P/E ratio that was the average of the industry Sears was competing with 
 This ratio would assume that Sears performance was on par with competitors such as Walmart and Target

 The TARP program also helped the US banks to be able to lend soon in order to boost economic recovery 
 However, future bailouts should be avoided because taxpayers' money should not be used to save large banks who have taken excessive risks 
 Macro-prudential tools, bank regulation and supervision would relieve the problem of excessive risk-taking and probably would not allow another financial crisis to prevail

 This presumes all information is priced into the value of the stock 
 But there are many who do not subscribe to this theory and thus the market price may not reflect all available information, thus rendering a P/E multiple inadequate for valuation purposes 
 The very idea of finding the fair value of a stock goes directly against efficient market theory because one takes the initial assumption that the market is not valuing the security properly given the available information 
 A company with negative earnings will be challenging to value based on P/E multiples given the fact that a multiple cannot be derived from this negative number 
 In which case one may turn to a different valuation metric 
 However, these multiples are essentially using past and present information 
 Well, as all prospectuses state, in very small print, past results are no guarantee of future results 
 You almost have to use a DCF model, as presumptuous as it may be, since you are investing for the future and need to forecast what possibilities lie in the future 
 Multiples based valuation of related companies also has the problem in that no two companies are the same nor are their products and services

 Take Apple and the iPhone as an example 
 With a focus on design, ease of use, and app integration, this product has outsold competitive smartphones, while commanding a high price 
 Launch of a product of this type will not be adequately captured by ratio methods, which assume the companies and their products are roughly comparable 
 Additionally, there are times (dot com bubble of 2000) when all stocks in a given industry may be strongly over or under valued, causing new companies to have similar valuation errors when a ratio based method is used 
 Additionally, a company reporting a non-typical earnings (or loss) year, may compare badly (undervaluation), but may recover in future years"

 I get that P/E Ratio can be used to weigh one company against another in the same industry 
 If that's all that this is - a relative metric used to help make a judgement - than that's fine, and I can run with that 
 It's just that right now P/E Ratio isn't making any intuitive sense to me 
 The problem that I have is when P/E is described in terms like this (and again, maybe I'm being too literal or too obtuse):  ""one stock is available for $10 
 It earns $1"" Unless you're getting back that $1 from the company as a result of your $10 stock purchase, your stock isn't earning anything for you. From what I understand the definition to be, price-per-share (P) is the price of a share of stock today, and earnings-per-share (E) are the one-year earnings of the company (past or forecast) divided by the number of outstanding shares of stock 
 It's the company that's earning the $1, not the investor (at least not directly) 
   I guess that the creation of this ratio seems somewhat out-of-the-blue to me 
 The units of P/E are in years, as in the number of years that it would take (at the past or forecast earnings levels) the company to earn (per share) the share price today 
 Is the origin of P/E stemming from treating the sale of stock as a liability 
 ""With a P/E of 20, it will take 20 years to earn enough to cover the current sale price of outstanding stock."" If this is the case, then P/E would be more of a measure of how over or under valued a company is relative to its peers in the same industry"

 It seems counter to the initial argument that one should use an average (rather than looking at last months return) to then imply that some increased incidence of outlier events is relevant 
 For example: if we were to show, much as in the initial video, the monthly returns of the markets in one of the months in which brazil had a highly negative return and the comparison country did better, one would select the other country

 For example,\nwhen one values Ford relative to other large carmakers, he assumes that these companies have been priced accurately (on average) by the market, although it probably misjudged them on an individual basis 
 So a stock might be overvalued on a discounted cash flow basis but undervalued on a multiple-based basis, if the pool of comparable companies used in the later valuation are all\noverpriced by the market 
 In other words, multiple-based valuation reflects the market mood, and in using that the value of an asset can\nresult in values that are too high, when the market is over valuing comparable\nfirms, or too low, when it is under valuing these firms 
 A recent example were multiple-based valuation would be a poor method is the  _domain_  crash, when tech companies were extremely overpriced by the market

 I am very fresh in this field and I don't know much about the history of stock markets, but I believe these methods may overlook some key aspects of companies in evaluation 
 For example :  If a company in evaluation is new and has a line up of ground breaking products or  patent, just looking at multiples may ignore the effect of potential growth in the fair evaluation of the stock of the company 
 That is to say, I think multiple methods assume no severe change in customer's habits, or innovations that may completely change the landscape of the market 
 An easy example would be a mistake one may have made evaluating Apple's stock by Nokia's multiples in early 2000 
 I believe loss is a very general word and all losses should not be treated the same 
 Loss may be due to a huge investment which promises to generate excellent income in future like Tesla Motors's investment in Mega Factory construction 
 Loss may be due to external events such as earth quick in Japan and its effect o Toyota's stock price 
 However, I admit that there are also types of loss that raises the red flag, for example a resulting loss due to decline in sale of films for film camera at the early ages of digital photography 
 Kodak was one of the major players in film industry which  failed to react to the market change in time and incurred huge losses in return

 Without that premise, there is no way to obtain a fair valuation using the multiples method 
 For example during the dotcom bubble, internet companies were traded at P/E ratios of up to 100. Those firms were greatly overvalued at that time and using them as a reference would have resulted in a huge overvaluation 
 This gets further distorted when companies report negative earnings, in which case the P/E ratio would naturally turn negative too, resulting in a massive undervaluation of a stock"

 If the Fed is using TARP and if economic agents assume it would do the same then they might not take proper caution to avoid such problems in the future

 However, the concern that this bailout somehow incentivises banks to be careless in their investment activity and risk management is not without merit 
 One way of addressing this concern is legislation mandating a certain percentage of bank profits towards a fund that can be used to repay the taxpayer and for future bailouts

 In history, Amazon who has been reported negative earnings for 20 years and private-held companies cannot easily used this model

 For ex 
 In India, when I try to compare p/e of two listed large banks viz. SBI & HDFC , normally find HDFC has higher p/e ratio (20) 
   The reason being SBI has been exposed to high non performing assets and thus equity market valuation (P) has been reduced and so do p/e(9) 
   On the other hand may be HDFC is trading at higher stock price due to bullish sentiment 
 In this situation it is hard to use these p/e multiples to value any new bank entering into Indian market based on existing p/e ratios of banks

 Personally, I'd be willing to take the volatility in equity, debt and cash in exchange for a reduction in opportunity cost - I also think that while gold is usually correlated to 'fundamentals' like inflation in the long run, it also seems to be prone to volatility in the very short term as investors overreact to events.\n"

 The only way out of this loop, seems to be the abolition of fractional reserve banking and requiring the banks to hold 100% reserves for the checking account of people and for this service they can charge a percentage of the transactions, services that are already being provided by companies  like PayPal and others 
 The banks can accept long term deposits or can have other investments but these investments should be done on separate balance sheets to ensure that even if there is a bubble and the bank loses a lot of its assets, the checking accounts are not touched 
 This way the government need not to provide any insurance to the banks on the investments that bank do 
 In fact the most  important phenomenon that we observe during failures in the market like the 2008 crisis is not that a bubble bursts, it is the fact that regular businesses that have checking accounts with those banks can not do  business anymore

 As they ""save the bad guys"" employing public resources, they are understandably criticised for perversing managers' incentives and incentivising reckless behaviors.\n This is the reason why the European Union has passed the Bank Recovery and  Resolution Directive, whose declared aim is to put an end to the use of taxpayers' money to rescue failing istitution, setting up the scene for bail-in tools and the creation of a resolution fund financed through a levy on banks  
  This is also the path taken by international bodies, as the Financial Stability Board, with the recent publication of the TLAC 
 However, in hindsight, the choice of the US federal goverment has been probabily the best one,cost-wise 
 Thanks to the TARP, the US banking sector was freshened up and lending istitutions were able to resume credit provision to households and corporations 
 On the other hand, here in Europe, Cocos bonds and other bailin-able istruments have been shunned by investors, and the huge amount of Non Performing Assets is still impinging on bank lending 
 \n To conlude, I think that the less painful solution would have been to wind down some istitutions, clean up the balance sheet of those banks that were still solvent, and bearing with the criticism of incentivising banks' risky behaviour

3630,2522,198,4,2017-09-09 07:14:49,"A small allocation in gold in specific time or market regime may be useful 
 It is important not to forget that gold is not producing income 
 Equities are generating (companies are producing cashflow and free cashflow to the benefit of shareholder), moreover some stocks keep up (sometime with a lag) very well with infation (especially compagnies with pricing power like oil and commo stocks) 
  Of course for geopolitical Risk or Risk on the stability of the monetary system gold is vers useful in a portfolio 
 A rule of thumb for the weight of gold in ouf portfolio would be: look at real yield (cost of opp), your expectation about inflation and monetary stability and what the market is currently telling (headline in the news, inflation expectation, inflation break-even in the ,tips market) 
  Create an easy formula that allocate between 0%  and 5% based on these 3 inputs 
 Exemple (1982-83 after Volker type of scenario): real yields are are positif, Because CB is fighting inflation (decrease the weight of gold) A lot of news About inflation and gold jumped in the last 24 months (less weight) You think inflation will be tamed in 2 years and market expectation does not agree (less weight -----> hold 1% of less of gold in your portfolio and you will take profit along if soir scenario is correct"

 The ""cost"" of the investment is instead represent by a measure of ""cost of opportunity"" 
  (C) Even for this case, the introduction of  a metrics that takes into account:    the commodity cost of gold and its recent variation (trend)   the cost of other commodities / currencies    the weighted average cost of capital   would finally provide a defined measure of the cost opportunity

 But that is only a problem for the very very rich 
 The only thing I disagree with is the fact that gold is expressed in Dollars 
 I think that should be the otherway around 
 Like we measure in meters as a standard 
 A standard unit should not change 
 If you determine the level of gold sensibly then you can handle the so called fluctuations in the price 
 I do think gold will never return to the 35 dollar again unless it finds a miracle use in industry in such a large scale that it would replace silver etc. i have witnessed the periods when people took all their money home; that form of cash autonomy is not to compare with plastic cards etc.  lets put it differently we buy kitchens and other expensive things; but then they never keep their value

3666,2533,314,4,2018-05-18 07:19:52,"We are assuming that the ratios are fair 
 In periods of market exuberance or gloom, the multiples are skewed and does not necessarily reflects the fundamentals of the company we are trying to value 
 In short, while DCF uses a lot of assumptions, it is based more on the fundamentals of a company whereas multiples valuation is more market based 
 For example, during a market turmoil like the subprime crisis in 2007/8, the entire stock market was badly hit and the valuations on stocks then would not have fully reflected the fundamentals of the company 
 A company that reported a loss may sway market participants to assign it a lower multiple that can be discounted to its fundamentals

 Reality is companies do not often trade at fair value in the short term 
 During a ""irrational exuberance"" time like the dot com era these ratios would have valued newer companies at a much higher value

 For instance the called “Dot-com bubble” 
  The value of most  internet sectors and related fields were overestimated by the market 
 In that case the comparison of a specific stock against other companies in the same field would lead to confirming such misleading overestimation 
 In regard to companies that just reported  a loss, I understand that only the indexes are not enough to support a consistent decision about the company value 
 More information about the circumstances of such loss need to be considered when appraising the value; such information should determine the reasons leading to the loss and should also support inferences about what are the chances of reverting the situation 
 Assuming that a company report a loss that has not enough power to significantly affects the company; and the economics factors are completely favorable

3743,2568,123,4,2017-10-02 15:35:02,"Valuing an asset typically involves establishing the value that would be assigned to it by participants 
 The comparable approach assigns value to an asset by reference to the \nobserved values of other assets with similar, but not necessarily \nidentical, characteristics 
 The technique relies on the proposition that\n assets having similar characteristics, especially risks and cash flow \nprospects, will trade at similar prices because otherwise arbitrage \nprofits would be possible 
 One key difference between the comparables approach and the DCF model is\n that comparables valuation does not explicitly spell out the economic \nagents’ expectations of future cash flows or discount rates 
 Instead, \nthe expectations and discount rates are embedded in the observed prices \nof the comparable assets 
 For example, transaction prices of comparable \nhouses can be thought of as discounted values of expected future rents \n(cash flows) that can be realised by an investor who purchases the \nhouse 
 Because being explicit about expectations and discount rates is \nnot needed to perform a comparables valuation, the methodology is \npotentially simpler to implement, but it is generally less transparent \nregarding the underlying assumptions"

3748,118,145,4,2016-03-05 20:06:00,"The bailout of the financial sector was necessary in the United States in part because of the Government's influence over mortgage loans; that is the US Government backed (underwrote) many of the loans that were issued to individuals who were not credit worthy 
 When the government guarantees such loans so that more people buy houses, in turn stimulating the economy, it creates the so called bubble ( an artificially inflated sector of the economy) 
   Thus, when the overall economy slowed down and millions of homeowners defaulted on their loans the whole system came to a halt 
 So, I believe the government had a bigger role in the crisis than what has been publicized and the bailout was necessary 
 If banks are left alone to determine who to lend to and who not to lend to; the credit market will be tight and not grow very fast - as in Japan 
 We hear the same issues again, not very long after the mortgage crisis, the government wants banks to promote lending to potential home buyers as a way to stimulate the economy 
 If the government underwrites loans banks loosen the lending standards and the whole process begins to heat up all over again 
 It's not an either/or situation it's a cycle and the government needs to stay out of the underwriting business"

 I think the US government did well by choosing the latter

 The basis upon which a deal is done is that firtsly a computational number is required and on the basis of that indication (number) other factors then determine a price  a buyer is willing to pay and hence a multiple is arrived at

 Even though all conditions can look like the same in a fact they could differentiate dramatically 
 For example, different accounting policies inside of the company can affect final multiples 
 Also, a management team can play a different game and hide many conditions which are not known for external players 
 I would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies in a time of ""bubbles"" 
  For instance, currently, we are having a boom with a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum 
 Many people are buying Bitcoin just because the price of it is growing rapidly, without understanding a single line of code from the blockchain technology 
 In this way, we can't rely on the date which we have out there because it's affected by speculation 
 About a company which just reported a loss, first of all, we need to analyze why it's happened 
 Maybe a company got into loss situation due to a bad management, but a business itself has perspectives 
 Thus it makes sense to buy some stocks while it has a lower price 
 On the other hand, likely company which has negative earnings isn't supposed to be attractive for investors"

 Further the general rule applies, namely that the companies should be from the same industry with the comparable financing structure.\n Using multiple-based valuation could be a bad choice, if the macroeconomic environment in a particular region changes or some unexpected policy and decisions are taken 
 Both aspects could have a significant influence on a short-term as well as a long-term ability of the companies to grow 
 Therefore the multiple-based valuation could disfigure a real value of respective companies and their stock price in the momentum of change 
 \n A similar approach applies for companies that just reported a loss 
 Although the multiples of such companies will be negatively affected in the moment they reported a loss, the constant yearly growth rate as well as future free cash flow could be very attractive

 If you are a novel investor who is just starting to take steps in the financial world, I can understand that, at that very moment, the percentage of your resources that are going to be destined to gold will be moderated or insufficient 
 The other scenario would be years later, when that same investor has already collected a high amount of benefits through his/her investment and has a comfortable position economically talking 
 That is the moment when he/she should be more aware of not losing his/her good financial position and not understimate the unlikely events that once in a while life hits us with 
 But, of course, as we have been taught, it depends on your own willingless to take more risks and more returns or viceversa

 In fact, Themis Themistocleus, one of our guest speakers from UBS, put it in the following words:  ""But you have to understand discounted cash flow makes a lot of assumptions over many years 
 People find it very cumbersome and it's also prone to mistakes 
 So they tend to take shortcuts, they tend to take simpler valuation methodologies like price to earnings, cash flow yield, dividend yield, to get an answer to what the fair value is.""   There is however a very important assumption we make when we use ratios we observe on the market (like price-to-earnings) to value other comparable companies 
 What could that assumption be 
 Were there instances in history where you would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies 
 What about companies that just reported a loss (i.e 
 Negative earnings)"

 Perhaps both these problems needed a controlling tool each 
 How does the Government :   Help the economy recover faster from the subprime crisis   Prevent this careless investment activity with the Banks   Perhaps the tools could involve   Removing illiquid, difficult to value assets from the economy buying them from the banks / perhaps implementing a kind of buy back policy for the consumers from the banks 
 Preventing the banks carelessness through greater controls and checks 
 Also implementing a way where the bank's margin on the loan products is reduced through a policy

3793,2592,210,4,2018-05-24 19:08:54,"I believe that this act was necessary as it ensured\nthe injection of credit into the U.S 
 Economy in order to stimulate spending,\nthereby raising incomes and rendering them more adequate to support debt repayments,\nreducing the need to sell assets in several markets, ergo raising asset values,\ncreating wealth, and making more people creditworthy 
 This would certainly not have\nbeen feasible if the Federal Funds Rate was simply reduced as in that case,\nbanks would have still had a great deal of non-performing loans and toxic\nderivatives in their balance sheet 
 Upon considering the fact that very large\ndebt repayments which were growing faster than income, thereby decreasing\nspending and subsequently, income, creditworthiness therefore affecting borrowing\nand the momentum of the growth of income, and asset values,  as a result the effective creation of credit\nwould have been a far-fetched dream for the U.S 
 Economy 
 However, the TARP tremendously\nreduced the risk in the balance sheets of large financial institutions and upon\nsupplementing that with growth-friendly monetary policy, a triumphant economic\nregulatory environment were created which put an emphasis on the facile\navailability of credit 
 This was not only beneficial for the U.S 
 Economy, but\nalso for that of the global economy not just because of increased\nglobalization, but also the amplification of such an effect as a result of the\nutmost interconnectedness of the global economy because of credit default\nswaps, which are financial instruments that serve as insurance against\nnon-payment 
 Such an instrument was facilitated by the creation of an agreement\nin which the lender agrees to pay premiums on the swap and if their client\ndefaults, the seller of the credit default swap agrees to pay the principal to\nthe lender 
 Therefore, credit default swaps were backed by the trust of the seller\nto pay the principal to the lender in the case of a credit event auction 
 In\nfact, the total value of credit default swaps in the market in the\npre-recession era was 20 times that of subprime mortgages and therefore, made\nfor the interconnectedness of balance sheets all over the world, so if one bank\nfailed, the effects would be felt throughout the world as that bank has\nprobably issued hundreds of credit default swaps 
 So, this bailout was not just\nfor the betterment of the U.S 
 Economy, but also that of the rest of the world.\nNevertheless, some state that this served as a source of bad incentives for\nmajor financial institutions 
 Nothing could be further from the truth as it was\nalso supplemented with increased regulatory mandates such as the Dodd-Frank\nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which mandated stricter\ndisclosure policies for such institutions and discouraged extensive\nrisk-taking 
 As a result, U.S 
 Bank balance sheets have since ballooned and\nhave much less leverage and risk than ever before, and healthy economic growth was\nempowered as a result 
 Also, the mentality which many Wall Street executives\nhad at the before the crisis, manifesting itself in the form of incentive\ntrumping ethics almost every time, has since been eradicated as a result of\nsuch acts 
 Some could even argue that the mandating of such reforms was far more\neffective than the $3.4 trillion worth of QE in 2008, as it was not a driver of\neconomic growth with it being in the same range post and pre QE (1.5% to 2%),\ngave incentives of corporations to buy back stock and not invest in large cash\nflow projects which would create employment and raise income, thereby constituting\na wealth effect for investors, and was not a driver of wage growth 
 Therefore,\nthe mandating of the TARP and it being supplemented with stricter regulation\nwas very effective when inaugurated with decreased interest rates as it\nefficiently and rapidly stimulated the U.S 
 Economy relative to that of other\neconomies with similar scales"

 I am not a finance expert, but my answer would depend on whether the TARP only directly benefited the banks, or if there as direct aid to other sectors 
 If it only benefited banks, then technically the US government is gambling that the aid will motivate the banks to lend, but it doesn't guarantee it 
 In addition, perhaps TARP was a good idea because the action was proven right by the ""recovery"" of the economy

 So, I believe, that it is the duty of governments to rebalance the resulting social inequity through effective and sustainable policies and in particular in investment in future social equity

 Taking this into account, I think the DCF valuation still has its place considering it is based only on numbers and statistics 
 One ought to stay conservative with its forecast of growth for it to make sense though

 Also depending on the goal of the company a P/E ratio can be very high, but the company itself not necessarily bad. They could be investing most of their earning in expanding or R&D, and thus not post high earnings 
 I cannot recall a specific moment in history where I wouldn't have been optimistic with using a multiple-based method, but can imagine that it is difficult to apply if you don't have all the information of a company

 Seeing that the US has the greatest financial sector worldwide, avoiding such a move would complicate things even more around the globe 
 On the other hand, even though there are many points for the bad incentives a bank might have, I think the banks and other financial institutions have also learned their lesson and wouldn't dream of repeating the same mistakes

 In addition, bubble economies, such as the dot-com bubble, will inflate the multiples across the whole market and thus skew valuation for all stocks in the bubble

3985,456,568,4,2017-04-23 16:39:20,"What we are talking about here is simply moral hazard, or the lack therein of bank policies 
 Looked at logically, there is no incentive for banks to moderate or indeed change any part of their lending practices 
 However, lending was never the issue for the so-called Great Recession 
 In fact, the depression from which we are still recovering was a result of the lack of segmentation in the Retail and Investment banking arms 
 What does this mean 
 The Great Depression was caused by massive speculative investment mania by ordinary citizens being allowed to borrow on margin into a roaring bull market where underlying value was detached from price of stocks 
 This inevitably led to a bubble or massive proportions and a resulting crash 
 However, many banks and lenders were allowed to go to the wall 
 Whilst some commentators believe that this was the root cause of the impact and sharp decline in the stock market value, the recovery was also relatively quick lasting approximately 3 years from start to finish 
 By contrast, because no banks were allowed to fail other than Lehman Brothers which was used an example of the systemic failure that could occur if other investment banks were allowed to go bust, this allowed the banking leaders (and root cause of the overvaluation of the housing market) to petition for TARP funding from the US government to the tune of $700 million in the first instance and much more subsequently as described in the previous video 
 Essentially, the government with the aid of Hank Paulson to justify the massive bail out of private banks with public money 
 It is worth remembering that government does not have any money other than through borrowing (bond market) or tax receipts, i.e 
 The earnings of private citizens and to a lesser extent companies who tend to offshore their earnings in tax friendly jurisdictions 
 So this is what is meant by Moral Hazard 
 Nothing other than the inefficient Dodd-Frank bill has been put in place to prevent a repeat of the Great Recession in the next couple of years 
 However, the bust this time will be much greater a) because the original debt has not been cleared by allowing banks to go bust and b) because the banks now believe that however they choose to make money they will be back-stopped by the tax payer - privatizing the profits and socializing the losses 
 In contrast, the Glass-Steagall act was introduced at the end of the Great Depression to separate Investment and Retail banking arms thereby preventing excessive risk taking by the speculation activity of Investment banks from adversely affecting the 'real economy' i.e 
 Business lending and private debt creation 
 The last part of this act was repealed by Clinton in 1999 under massive lobbying from the larger banks and this allowed the creation of banking monoliths such as Citigroup (so-called 'Too Big to Fail' institutions)and also the creation of extremely exotic synthetic investment products such as CDO's, securitized mortgages, virtualized securitized mortgage backed securities underwritten by the ratings agencies who were at once employed and expected to be dispassionate about the risk involved in producing these products which no-one actually understood 
 The cross-selling and  mixing of these products by investment banks meant that no-one understood exactly what assets belonged to whom, leading to a loss of confidence and so-called Credit Crunch when banks refused to lend to each without exorbitant inter-bank lending rates 
 The Central banks were then called upon to act as the lender of last resort which in this instance was the correct approach as the actual situation at the end of 2008 was much more serious than that in 1929 
 This would have been an effective strategy only in so far as it allowed risky assets to be disposed of and bank balance sheets brought under control reducing the leverage from in some cases up to 40:1 down to more historically manageable levels, perhaps around 9:1 
 This unhappily has not happened, and the opportunity has been lost to achieve this aim. This means that the bank balance sheets are in poor shape as they were and consumers are likewise carrying huge burdens of debt 
 Growth levels have been weak because of this and in fact despite the lowest interest rates ever recorded, there is little appetite for more debt 
 Debt is linked to growth of consumer spending in the US which has a knock-on effect for exporting economies such as the Eurozone which typically does not have the same level of private consumption"
3986,2667,218,4,2016-06-21 15:03:06,"I would have a relatively large part of my portfolio invested in Gold (maximum 20%) not only as an insurance for a black swan event but also because its value have been increasing over the years unlike currencies which fluctuates from time to time 
 As mentioned in the videos, gold are used as a hedge against inflation, deflation and also against the declining in the dollar value 
 Although these are some critical reasons why persons who are not risk takers should invest a large part of their portfolio in gold, it's not truly my reason for choosing that amount 
 The reason is that gold has preserve its value for thousand of years from way back to 3000 BC and the value has been increasing steadily ever since due to the increasing demand over these years 
 Gold has become part of cultures and traditions for some countries which leads to its demand, and an increase in demand always lead to an increase in price"

 For instance, when UBER was born, it was hard to figure out its enterprise value using multiple-based methods as there were no practically ""comparable"" companies: the car calling/sharing business UBER created was an entirely blue-ocean market 
 And even though Alphabet and Apple are both categorized as tech companies, their business nature are quite different: Apple's earnings are primarily driven by selling hardwares (e.g 
 IPhone/iPad/Mac) whereas Google's income comes from advertising fees plus other internet services 
 So it would be reckless to simply derive Apple's share price by using Google's P/E multiples 
 3) the multiples correctly reflect the enterprise value 
 However, this is not the case when markets are having bubbles or experiencing crashes 
 The multiples tend to deviate dramatically from its fair value during these periods 
 (e.g 
 _domain_  bubble and its subsequent crash) 4) the multiple-based methods explicitly require that companies being valued have positive earnings 
 This is not the case for most (tech) start-ups or companies in early stages as they are essentially surviving/expanding by using investors money"

 That is the qualitative factors pertaining to the leadership are similar, both companies are in the same stage of business cycle and both companies will react similarly to external stimulants 
 One of the instance where i was not satisfied with multiple valuation is when I was valuing a IPO of a women's inner wear brand lovable lingerie (LL) 
  The comparable Page industries and Rupa & Co 
 Were mature brands with significant market share 
 Comparing the two firms was like trying to give valuation of Nokia phones to an iPhone in its early years 
 LL was a rapidly growing brand and assigning it a PE of a mature company didn't feel ideal 
 Hence, DCF valuation was the most optimum method 
 In case of negative earnings it is important to identify the source of negative earnings, if it is a one off event or recurring event, Or if the the company is still in its growth stage where its sill seeking growth in market share while compromising on its earnings

4074,873,356,4,2016-07-09 11:12:37,"After seeing the videos on gold and formally learning how it can be used to hedge against fortuitous events, I think having gold as part of one's portfolio is an important insurance that a prudent investor should not under-estimate nor overlook 
 If I were to decide on how much of my portfolio should be invested in gold, I will probably invest in gold only at the optimal level, or the level where you balance the benefits of holding gold as a hedge vis-a-vis the cost of gold investments (both opportunity and carrying cost) 
   Although I acknowledge the difficulty of determining this optimal level due to the difficulty of predicting extreme events that have a negative impact on the performance of alternative investment options, I also believe that it is important to consider the concept of risk and return in making these decisions 
 The risk in this case is the happening of an extreme event that will have an adverse effect on non-gold investments, whereas the return is the interest and/or gain that one will earn when investing in traditional assets 
 In the end, I think there should be a balance, extreme events are highly unlikely (although not impossible) and the number of their occurrence are few and far in between, so might as well take some risk and rake the returns, anyway, in the event that black swans happen, at least the returns you earned during the good times will somehow offset the impact of the negative extreme events 
 In conclusion, I will put a small portion of my portfolio in gold investments as hedge but not too much as to forego the gains of holding other investments and/or assets"

4116,2724,8,4,2016-10-03 17:06:45,"One must have a very good idea of clients' attitudes to risk in general before answering the question 
  I would see those who are risk-averse as wanting higher gold holdings 
 Most investors are conscious of the old picture of ""the miser"", who hoards heaps of gold in his cellar and practically nothing else 
 Gold has all of the benefits explained by Prof 
 Girardin, and all of the draw-backs, not least illiquidity and high opportunity costs 
 There are different types of risk-aversion, from the moderate (which may be no more than common prudence) to the extreme, whereby the mere knowledge that invested funds may have lower returns than anticipated induces a state of lethargy 
 (This lethargy may be so severe as to cause complete avoidance of financial markets altogether, as these are built on risk.) For those who would ideally prefer no risk, but accept it as some sort of necessary evil, a larger than average allocation to gold in a portfolio might make them sleep easier at night 
 I imagine that a flock of black swans would have to land before gold would be entirely necessary 
 These would include a prolonged period of stock market weakness, a catastrophic and irreversible plunge in the value of ALL world currencies, not just the dollar, accompanied by rampant hyper-inflation 
 Indeed so bad would things have to become that the possibility of fiat currencies backed by gold would no longer be enough to restore confidence in money without its replacement by gold coinage 
 But should holdings of gold merely reflect risk aversion, with those not troubled by possibilities of a major calamity occurring holding little or no gold 
 My opinion is that it is only those with large gold holdings who would be able to react to periods of prolonged panic 
 Smaller amounts are unlikely to provide sufficient protection"

 In special in crisis times, meanly in emerging markets, contagions effects, as happened in 2008 with the global financial crises moves the international markets ignoring the valuation methods 
 Just to remember after the financial crises, a lot of economists and agents of the financial markets thought that some emerging markets economies would not be affect by the global financial crisis, because those economies had improved their fundamentals in the beggining of 2000s, and consequently had good multiple valutions indicators

  That’s not to say you shouldn't have gold as an investment, but if you’re choosing to do so, you shouldn’t hold it as a physical investment 
 So, you should put a small percentage of your portfolio in gold for a long time frame 
 But, historically you will make more money in a 100% equity portfolio; however, if your risk tolerance doesn’t allow you to do that and you don’t want to place money in traditional bonds or other fixed income positions, gold may be a good alternative

  An important characteristics of these events is that they are impossible (or very hard) to predict until it’s too late 
 So to hedge against these events, an investor would have to hold some gold at all time in his or her portfolio as an insurance, instead of waiting for the last moment when the price of gold is likely to have already shot up 
 On the other hand, we have also seen that holding gold entails an opportunity cost meaning that during periods where no extreme events take place, you miss the opportunity of making returns by investing in other financial assets (e.g 
 Stocks or bonds which are supposed to reward you over time for your invested capital) in addition to the possibility of seeing the price of gold decrease as the memories of past extreme events disappear from the minds of other investors who progressively liquidate their gold position 
 So, would you rather have a relatively large part of your portfolio invested in gold at all times as an insurance, or a relatively small part and stomach the impact that extreme events may have on traditional assets, with the conviction that these assets are ultimately the ones that will enhance your living standard because they are supposed to reward you for your invested capital"

 Personally I dispute the generally accepted theory that the Fed had to rescue the existing banks 
 With the massive amount of money that was spent bailing out the existing banks, that had made terrible decisions, they could have established several entirely NEW banks with pristine balance sheets, and they could have purchased the bad loans books of the existing banks for say 30 cents on the dollar 
 This would have done two things; (1) people would not have lost their homes, as they would have simply changed the bank that they were making payments to, and (2) it would have purged the banking system of its debt burden, and if the old banks became insolvent, then they deserved that 
 Only the share holders and bond holders of the old banks would have lost money, not the general population 
 Because the setting up of the new banks is paid for by the taxpayer, every taxpayer could have been given shares in the new banks 
 The situation we have now is, innocent people have had their wealth destroyed, and we have huge income inequality, old bank executives have been given the licence to do it all over again, and the Fed has no tools left to face the next crisis, together with the problem of how to reduce its 3.5 trillion dollar balance sheet"

 This lead to the economy falling down even further 
 This is precisely the reason why these banks control trillions of dollars 
 On the other hand by bailing these banks every time some crisis occurs, would lead to carelessness of the banks 
 It is important to stabilise the economy, so the avoid carelessness and bailing out by the government central banks every time, it is important that proper regulations are made by the central bank"

 This assumption is subject to a number of variable factors, particularly recent earnings reports 
 A company's valuation may quickly become over- or under-inflated due to the emotions of investors following good or bad news 
 If using a company with a recent fluctuation in stock price for comparison, the valuation may be inaccurate 
 Another factor could be inflation of earnings by comparable companies 
 Fiat Chrysler, for instance, just reported that the company has inflated sales prices for the past three years on new cars 
 The valuation of the company is subject to change based on this information 
 If Fiat Chrysler was used as a comparable company to evaluate a comparable company, the valuation will be inaccurate"

4397,2845,388,4,2018-06-04 21:35:36,"In our company we use DCF in almost all cases when valuating the operational business subsidiaries 
 Based on the strategic plan and the budgets a DCF is possible and according to my view the best way to find a company value or to defend your book value as shareholder 
 P/E ratios are the exception for valuating investments but used in case of start ups or early stage companies 
 There you have negative cash flows and DCF makes no sense 
 But P/E ratios should only be applied by companies of the same industry or sector at the same stage of development and with a similar financing structure 
 To find these data is not so easy and it can be quite misleading 
 Please have a look at the  _domain_  disaster at the beginning of 2000 where a many companies with negative cash flows were valued incredibly high until the whole thing collapsed"

   He gives very good points explaining why the price of gold will rise in the short/medium term"
4399,981,330,4,2017-06-18 11:05:47,"The most glaring risk when attempting to value a company based on market ratios is to believe that all enterprises within the same market have the same business behaviour 
 That is dangerous because it fails to take into account aspects that are unaccounted for and yet could unleash tremendous value, such as a dominant market position or promising R&D on future IP 
 It also fails to take into account discrepancies in investment cycles 
 Indeed, companies X and Y belonging to the same market might not invest the same amounts, at the same time, and for similar time-scales 
 Most importantly, especially in our age of ""multidisciplinary corporations"", multiples-based valuation method may not allow to capture the value a company might have or has the potential to reach, in other, often unsuspected, markets 
 There are plenty of instances to outline all the risks detailed above, but the most striking example to me is Amazon, Inc.  This company has built market dominance in e-commerce, that took years for investors to actually value 
 It also continuously lost money, so it's P/E ratio came inconsistently with market norms 
 Its investments as well as R&D expenditures, especially in cloud computing, were underestimated 
 And, it captured new markets such as indeed cloud computing but now retail, with the acquisition of Whole Foods 
 So Amazon has repeatedly come up as a company that was under- or overvalued using multiples-based valuation 
 PS: I'm also neglecting many variables such as management style, leadership strength, quality of early investors, level of transparency and audit purity, credit risk and so forth 
 But I'm closing down to the most obvious"
4400,2846,24,4,2016-03-29 13:51:51,"I believe that some institutions are so important that they should become recipients of beneficial financial and economic policies from governments or central banks 
 The economies of scale in banks and in other businesses are worth preserving, so long as they are well regulated in proportion to their economic clout 
 \n However, to avoid one of the problems this creates -moral hazard- I believe that such large organisations should be deliberately broken up 
 According to Alan Greenspan, ""If they're too big to fail, they're too big"" 
  Failure is an integral part of any market system 
 So, although the financial institutions that were bailed out were indeed important to the financial system, the fact that they took risk beyond what they would otherwise, should be enough for the Government to let them face the consequences of their actions 
 It would have been a lesson to motivate institutions to proceed differently next time 
 How they face these consequences is up for debate, although as I earlier mentioned, I recommend that such organisations be broken up"

 I believe is a necessary evil, because as the videos showed, it is hard to stimulate an economy, and today it seems that the only way to do so, is to provide cheap money or cheap loans to promote spending 
 And in order to have those cheap loans, is to provide a secure and healthy banking system 
 I also believe that this bailout policy has been a bad incentive for the banks, because as being ""protected"" by the governments, they are in a ""secure"" position to do mistakes, as for example the US housing bubble crisis, which the ""Big Short"" film shows

 To prevent this from happening again, the government should stop incentivizing banks' careless behavior from smaller scale mistakes, so that they won't accumulate and become a mistake too big to the economy"

 The same citizens who have savings in banks are also taxpayers and have the right to make use of tax money to save their accounts and future 
 I am sure that this creates a tense environment on the decision making within banks and does not allow space for risky investments in the short term

 Financial structure, growth stage and industry risks) but what we do not take into account are the Who What and How which might make one company more valuable than the other one which won't be reflected by the stock prices immediately 
 The assumption we make when we use ratios is that they are mutually competitive and will have similar performance in the market 
 A perfect example of when a multiple based valuation method would have been a bad idea is during the  _domain_  bubble 
 By comparing with similar companies would have lead to incorrect forecasts and ultimately overvaluation of a given company

 I think that there is one more point of view which I share - US government payed a price by bailing out these toxic assets for it's omission to control and impose regulation on regulate investing practices and product that led to financial crisis in 2008

 By combining many value drivers into a point estimate, multiples may make it difficult to disaggregate the effect of different drivers, such as growth, on value 
 The danger is that this encourages simplistic – and possibly erroneous – interpretation It's Static, a multiple represents a snapshot of where a firm is at a point in time, but fails to capture the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of business and competition 
 It can have Difficulties used to make comparisons of relative value 
 But comparing multiples is an exacting art form, because there are so many reasons that multiples can differ, not all of which relate to true differences in value 
 For example, different accounting policies can result in diverging multiples for otherwise identical operating businesses 
 The use of multiples only reveals patterns in relative values, not absolute values

 On the other hand, there should be some measures of punishment for bad and risky management 
 For example, central bank may choose one financial institution and leave it without help as an example for others

4572,981,361,4,2017-06-24 09:57:16,"The answer should mostly reside on the characteristics of the numerous black swans that we want to take into account 
 First of all, you would want to make sure that the worst-case scenario which is impacting your portfolio as a whole, can be balanced by the potential gains the gold would make within such context 
 That's the actuarial, statistical approach 
 But that's not all. Gold can indeed act as a prominent hedge against multiple financial risks, yet it is far from alone 
 Frontier vehicles such as art or wine may also provide a respectable hedge under similar and perhaps wider-contexted environments and, therefore, limits the extent to which gold may take a share of an efficient portfolio 
 Furthermore, gold is so prominent in financial history that it confers it some disadvantages: the political risks 
 Indeed, nation states can consider gold reserves as strategic and part of their national security, therefore access to gold may be restricted, and governments may even seize gold assets for political motives 
 Last but not least, there are some black swan scenarios that themselves involve high risk for the value of gold itself 
 My favourite one is probably the advent of fin-tech and cryptocurrency 
 If a virtual-based asset class becomes a genuinely secure way to hedge against the same risks that gold is supposed to counter, then market psychology might finally consider gold as a mere commodity, like nickel, and therefore all of its financial appeals may just be replaced by the virtually-issued one. All of this taken into context makes it so that gold does not longer represent a fascinating hedge or any form of long-term insurance 
 I would, therefore, simply use it as another asset class like bonds, stocks, currencies and so forth 
 That is, with its risks and rewards, but no longer the same view that history regards it so"

 For this to stand logically, then the companies that we compare our stock with must have approximately the same capital structure, returns on invested capital and expected growth rates 
 Also the P/E ratio is subject to distortions in differences of accounting rules-such as restructuring charges and write-offs- and capital structures between companies 
 So if the companies that we compare are of similar industry, similar volume and calculate their earnings in the same way the P/E ratio is indeed a good measure of valuation 
 However better measures of valuation for companies even with this criteria are enterprise-based ratios, which unlike the P/E ratio are independent of capital structures"

 This even grows further when looking at the European Union and the support to whole countries, which one can argue fosters the same sort of incentives 
 Overall, I guess even if the government would not have bailed out the financial sector, it would certainly have caused even more dramatic consequences, but in the end, the incentives for taking risks in the financial sector just outweigh (at least in the short term) the actual risk

 Therefore the Federal Reserve used tax payers money to bail out banks that intentionally carried out careless practices that can be repeated in the future

  So, using average multiple of comparable companies means that comparable companies have similar equity cost i.e 
 Risk profile and growth rate 
 3 
 Share price converges to the average multiple of comparable companies 
 Etc. We can encounter the situation in which those assumptions cannot be appropriate 
 In the case when companies reported a loss, I tried to calculate normal earning power of evaluated companies (the company who creates loss forever cannot be sustainable as going concern, so normal earning excluding temporary setback can be positive), but such way also includes many assumption similar to DCF. In the short, all valuation including DCF and multiples is based on many assumptions about uncertain future 
 So, I think that valuation is not science but some sort of art or just tool for explanation to others"

 Instead of bailing out banks in the future, it may work better creating some kind of insurance for the users accounts on the investment offices (maybe tighter than the normal banking accounts insurances) that can help to avoid the kind of panics seen in 2007 and at the same time avoid bad incentives to the managers of this subsidiaries"

 When we say: ""When evaluating each of the following statements, assume all other variables were estimated correctly.""  we mean that you should treat each statement as a separate question 
 For each statement, you should ask yourself: ""What would be the impact of this mistake on my estimate of the stock price all other things equal"" 
  We put this hint to avoid people getting mixed up with reasoning such as ""if I overestimated the constant growth rate, what would be the impact of the WACC?"" 
  In this example, you should ignore the WACC (and other variables) if you are trying to measure the impact of the overestimation of the constant growth rate on your estimate of the stock price 
 I hope this helps 
 I will try to clarify this in the quiz 
 Best regards, Jonas"

 Collectively, these factors add up to a large assumption on top of which there is the assumption that the earnings analysis is correct which may not always be the case particularly for overseas stocks where accounting conventions differ 
 Nevertheless, the ration most used for company valuations is the P/E ratio or a variant of it 
 In bull markets P/E ratios tend to be higher reflecting general market optimism and the the opposite in a bear market scenario 
 In a bubble the ratios tend to get way out of sync with reality which makes valuation increasingly challenging 
 For example, the dotcom era witnessed extreme valuations for companies with no earnings records 
 Companies like Amazon, Google, and E-Trade all had multiples over 100 without any significant earnings

 Economist Lacy Hunt: ( link:   The evidence speaks for itself: the Fed cannot print money 
 The Fed does not have the authority or the mechanism to print money 
 They have not, they are not and they will not print money under present laws 
 It is a major oversimplification to say increasing the money supply leads to inflation 
 Under many circumstances--e.g 
 The money supply rose in the 1980s but inflation did not occur because of limited velocity This may be outside the scope of this course but the subject is interesting and important 
 The equation is MV=PY where M is money supply , V velocity, P prices, and Y output

 There are many examples of bubbles, Tulips of course, and cryptocurrencies very recently 
 I would not have assumed there existed a housing bubble, but I never personally was interested in cryptocurrencies 
 Depending on when the valuation takes place, the influence of the short term popularity, and thus market price, will have a disproportionate influence on the company's valuation with potentially huge margins of error 
 From a theoretical perspective a negative earnings report could unnecessarily lower the target companies valuation, especially if the earnings were due to operational inefficiencies or short term temporal effects impacting the public company and not the private one.

 However, one needs to question the premise of wanting the economy to recover fast, as to how fast 
 Why recover fast 
 These same banks were created at some point in the past when the economy already existed(I understand times are different but the market has, is and will always be the market and will regulate itself) so if the current financial institutions fail and come to an end, then by the efficient market or rational economy principle, much better and efficient financial institutions must come into existence 
 After all we need efficient markets which depends on reliable financial institutions 
 If one were to look at this from Behavioral Economics, then we again see that there are more disadvantages(in the long term) to wanting to recover the economy fast than actually seeking to let the market plays its role 
 Because we are once again not taking into account the role human behavior plays in a market and rather procrastinating this inclusion into the market for the future

 Now the assumptions the multiple valuations is the comaparable firms should be in the same industry and have similar growth in the market p 
 When using the P/E multiple, the company should have a similar financing structure 
 Now with having a low experience regarding the field I don’t have an example of companies favouring to the multiple valuation method and the companies who have faced risk 
 But when the companies faces risk it is due to the valuation errors made by them 
 There are three valuation approaches that are required to be considered every valuation analysis, each with its commonly used valuation methodologies 
 Asset approach Income approach Discounted cash flow method Market approach  Now the valuation errors which occur are Confusion of equity value with the enterprise value Failure to consider normalizing adjustments Assumption that net income = net cash flows Unsupportable long term growth rate  Lack of tax affecting or pass through entities  Improper reconciliation of multiple valuation approaches Now these are the errors which are considered in market valuation but reagarding it the multiple valuation is favoured rather than discounted valuation method cause it gives accurate results and helps to analyse the market and to have grasp to future assumed profits"

4842,1822,731,4,2017-03-26 23:08:39,"Firstly the assumption you are making is that the market is efficient and fairly valuing the company 
 In times of rising stock markets, the price of individual stocks & sectors tend to be overvalued and hence do not provide a fair comparable for multiple valuations 
 The same is true in bear markets where stocks are deeply undervalued and hence are not a good comparable for multiple valuations 
 During the tech bubble and the global financial crisis, prior to the crashes in both instances, stocks were highly overvalued and hence I would not be comfortable using multiples based valuation at that point 
 Negative earnings on a stock also distorts the P/E value as it is impossible to do a comparable valuation with a company who is reporting losses

 BAC and C get almost wiped out if it was not for the bail out, JPM on the other hand had excellent management and a rock solid balance sheet which allowed them to weather the crisis with less turmoil than either C  or BAC. Therefore using BAC or C ratios to get a valuation for JPM would dramatically undervalue JPM"

 For the banks, I believe, it was a bit of a black eye - having to be bailed out by the government, which is still being discussed today 
 And while these banks want to take risks in pursuit of high(er) returns, they have new controls in place that prevent them from taking it too far. Were these bad incentives

 Bailing the financial sector out was necessary as it prevented a 1929 type scenario, and even though the US economy has made the most recovery, however, most of the liquidity has fuelled asset price growth which is great for investors but not beneficial for the society at large 
 Letting the banks ""off the hook"" has created a precedent for using taxes in order to bail out institutions considered too systematically important to the economy and from the bank's perspective, this has allowed them to carry on with taking on higher risk investments in order to seek the greatest returns, without taking full responsibility for the downside 
 This is a very bad incentive as excessive risk taking is likely to reoccur as a the most risky operations are usually the most profitable

 So, in the interest of the US economy and the world economy at large I think it is right for the Governments to bail out the banks and incentivize them to lend more 
 The banks are not having a free lunch either 
 The bailout comes with some stringent regulations and rules that will restrain banks from indulging in speculative and risky strategies 
 So hopefully banks will be more conscious of their practices going forward and will not put themselves in a position wherein they will seek a Government bailout 
 Apportioning the bail out funding between bond holders and shareholders rather than the taxpayers will call for more regulation of banks' practices

 A valuation multiple is simply an expression of market value of an asset relative to a key statistic that is assumed to relate to that value 
 You would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies when that statistic – whether earnings, cash flow or some other measure – does not bear a logical relationship to the market value observed, when it is not seen as the driver of that market value 
 A multiple is a distillation of a great deal of information into a single number or series of numbers 
 By combining many value drivers into a point estimate, multiples may make it difficult to disaggregate the effect of different drivers, such as growth, on value 
 The danger is that this encourages simplistic – and possibly erroneous – interpretation 
 A multiple represents a snapshot of where a firm is at a point in time, but fails to capture the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of business and competition 
 Multiples are primarily used to make comparisons of relative value 
 But comparing multiples is an exacting art form, because there are so many reasons that multiples can differ, not all of which relate to true differences in value 
 For example, different accounting policies can result in diverging multiples for otherwise identical operating businesses 
 The use of multiples only reveals patterns in relative values, not absolute values such as those obtained from discounted cash flow valuations 
 If the peer group as a whole is incorrectly valued (such as may happen during a stock market ""bubble"") then the resulting multiples will also be misvalued 
 Multiples are based on historic data or near-term forecasts 
 Valuations based on multiples will therefore fail to capture differences in projected performance over the longer term, and will have difficulty correctly valuing cyclical industries unless somewhat subjective normalization adjustments are made 
 Companies with losses (negative earnings) or no profit have an undefined P/E ratio (usually shown as ""not applicable"" or ""N/A""); sometimes, however, a negative P/E ratio may be shown 
 There are multiple versions of the P/E ratio, depending on whether earnings are projected or realized, and the type of earnings

 Lets say of my Investment capital 60% goes to potentially fast growing investment, eg public stocks and private investments 
 Then 40% left for less risky investments cannot all be committed to gold since other forms of investments such as bonds and money market still exist 
 I would think a more productive strategy would be to invest gains from all investments in gold to secure your gains continue investing the principal in other growing investments

 From a moral standpoint, and maybe educational one, it was a more satisfactory policy by letting the banks pay a high price for their mistakes 
 But the consequences to the rest of the economy were immediate  and very negative 
 With TARP, the US government and the US Central Bank did what was needed for the economy to keep on going 
 Had they not done it, the financial problems would have continued and contaminated the real economy: eg the fact that banks could not refinance their operations would lead them to stop lending for the daily operation of businesses, and the economy would come to a halt 
 This is what happened during the great depression in 1929 
 Ben Bernanke was actually a specialist of that era and avoided those drastic consequences 
 It is not useful to think that behaviour of banks can be educated like human beings 
 Faced with a small risk of losing everything, and a high chance of making a lot of money, there will always be companies that will go for the risky way even if there is a risk for the whole system

 If we look at the managing level, the late CEO of Apple is definitely a more visionary leader and still considered as a technology icon  
  Probably that would give Apple software developers and designers some sort of advantage, but we can't precisely measure the extent of that 
 Competitive advantages cannot be totally predictable, as Samsung faced issues with their late Galaxy Note 7, Apple had a clear shot at 'plus' sized smartphones and tablets by producing more reliable devices 
 What about markets 
 Apple is working really hard to get to the South Korean market where Samsung has been leader for so long and obviously has an national 'pride' advantage 
 On the other hand, I don't think Samsung would face the same hardships selling its products on US markets 
 We can probably go further and compare the IT, design and marketing expertise available on Silicon Valley, California where Apple is based and recruiting its future employees to the levels of these skills on the Korean level

 Leverage is risky 
 I think the point Michel wanted to make is that you cannot determine the whole risk (""global risk"") of a portfolio only by looking at its leverage

 Also, what does ""high"" leverage mean 
 Some might say a leverage of 2:1 is huge 
 At the very end of its existence, LTCM had a leverage of 250:1

 Money in cash is liquid and all the money printed by the Central Banks circulates in the transactions of the market 
 Suppose, an economy produces $1 Billion worth of goods, for example: 100 million bags worth $10 
 If the government doubles it's money supply, we would still have 100 million bags but people will have double the money (assuming even distribution of money ) they initially possessed and hence, the price of the same bag inflates to $20 
 In conclusion,   If governments print money to pay off national debt, inflation would rise 
 This increase in inflation would reduce the value of bonds 
 If inflation increases, people will not want to hold bonds because their value is falling 
 Therefore, the government will find it difficult to sell bonds to finance the national debt 
 They will have to pay higher interest rates to attract investors 
 If the government print too much money and inflation gets out of hand, investors will not trust the government and it will be hard for the government to borrow anything at all.   Therefore, printing money could create more problems than it solves

 ): 1) Market valuation means market capitalization 
 So in other words, Price * Shares 
 If you grab the price of a world stock index (E.g 
 Vanguard total market), then you can observe total market valuation with the use of a stock index 
 It all depends on the weighting, but this question, to my idea, can be seen as true 
 2 and 3) Are obviously correct 
 With booms and bust come overvalued and undervalued (or at fair value) markets 
 But a market can always become cheaper and more expensive 
 In other words, they can always move up and down 
 This can, for instance, be viewed in the light of the P/E ratio (how much earnings do i get for the stock price I pay?) 4) Seems incorrect 
 Some companies have little earnings but still have gigantic valuations (i.e 
 Unicorns such as Whatsapp) based on potential future earnings 
 They might not make a lot of money now, but they're expected to in the future, and thus have a strong price 
 As such, the market's valuation of the company is higher than book value (what it is worth now), due to the expectation of future growth

 Microsoft and Apple ) 
  for the last part of the question, it would be rather conflicting to say that while companies of the comparative field reported a loss, the valuating company may or may not be expected to report a loss looking at current circumstances and time and again this has happened where exceptionally a company survives a common harm factor which may be rule of extinction to other companies of compare

 So the FED and the Chinese gov should be given credits 
 However, the side-effect of such bailout is the incentives for large banks to take advantage of such help and try more crazy things, expecting the government to save them again

 Or that their balance sheets are honestly representing the firm's condition 
 In addition, another assumption is that there actually are comparable firms in the same industry and at a similar stage of development 
 This could not always be possible (I think about SpaceX by Elon Musk), and therefore there could be some temptation to compare firms with not-so-similar companies 
 Moreover, we are presuming that firms in the same industry face the same operating risk, and that companies at a similar stage of development have the same growth sales 
 I think this cannot always be possible 
 And, in addition, this method does not take into account the different competition positioning of firms"

5272,2277,30,4,2016-10-14 18:17:59,"A big concern I have is the impact of low interest rates created by central banks on equities and value of fixed income holdings 
 Cheap money may fuel economic growth but sustained cheap money can have series consequences on the willingness of investors to put their money to work - given the looming uncertainty about interest rates and their effect on portfolios, real or financial 
 I would be short on fixed income securities if I suspect interest rates are going to rise 
 Perhaps I would the same for equities depending on what I believe the P/E should be 
 This is a time for hedging up 
 Sure, if bank returns are low because of interest rates, investors including banks have to chase yield or higher returns 
 This puts them at great risk 
 Operationally, banks have to be creative in identifying new revenues streams to help offset low interest earning on loans for example 
 Take the case of Wells Fargo in its efforts to boost earning being rather reckless in churning, cross selling and other devices to extract revenues and fees from clients 
 If banks are reluctant to lend more liberally, other financial institutions step their place without the degree of oversight and scrutiny of bank regulators - putting more cash and hard assets at risk"

 Gold isn’t unique in this respect  inflation-indexed bonds tend to move the same way but it’s always good to diversify economic exposures across a range of assets 
 This makes it a good hedge for those times when your fiat cash earns less than what it used to in real interest, whether it’s because of financial repression, diminished growth prospects, the so-called 
 This suggests gold should have relatively small weight as a proportion of short-term liquid assets in a neutral portfolio , a relatively small part"
5283,29,596,4,2016-07-18 02:48:10,"Generally, I think the higher the interest rate on the bonds, the more risky it is 
 The borrower needs to pay the lender more money because it is riskier 
 You also have to consider the situation of the lender in general too. Too much debt is risky, and debt on top of debt is even riskier, because there is a greater chance the debts will not be repaid (default) 
  Depending on how the Index is weighted, if higher interest rate Greek bonds become a bigger part of the Index, then it will shift the entire Index 
 Since the Index is a composite of multiple EU bonds, it's like adding a higher number to a group of numbers that would shift the average for all of them higher"

5305,525,425,4,2018-06-26 08:40:48,"Stock investing requires careful analysis of financial data to find out the company's true worth 
 This is generally done by examining the company's profit and loss account, balance sheet and cash flow statement 
 This can be time-consuming and cumbersome 
 An easier way to find out about a company's performance is to look at its financial ratios 
 Though this is not a foolproof method, it is a good way to run a fast check on a company's health 
 For instance, a high PE indicates that the stock is either overvalued (with respect to history and/or peers) or the company's earnings are expected to grow at a fast pace 
 But one must keep in mind that companies can boost their P/E ratio by adding debt (thereby constricting equity capital) 
  Also, as future earnings estimates are subjective, it's better to use past earnings for calculating P/E ratios 
 So you need to find out the causes of the negative earnings of a company 
 The starting point in forecasting the cash flows of a company is to understand how the sales, costs, profits and cash flows of a company would develop over a long period of time, So you need to understand what are the key drivers for the company's sales 
 Those could be innovation, trends in consumption, consumers's taste 
 The costs can be influenced by the cost of raw materials, the cost of labor 
 You also need to understand how the company sit within the competitive environment, because the consumers have multiple choices 
 The quality of management and their decisions influence the company's performance 
 So, you need to take those factors together to establish the fair value of the company and to understand the short term dynamics of equities before investing in equities"

 DCF method provides a guide should an investment be made i.e with positive NPV, however this is not the same case with multiples

 The rootcauses of the crisis, particular in 2008, displayed more about management and free market principles, than it indicated bad performances of companies 
 Similar to companies that just reported a loss, I would been less comfortable in using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies 
 In order to assess a financial crisis or a negative earning of a company properly, a company portfolio is very important; is the loss a result of bad management, market trends or did the company suffer from a natural disaster 
 The reason behind the loss and the financial crisis can than also help in predicting the chances of a reoccuring loss in the following year or not.

5353,116,917,4,2016-01-30 18:11:28,"Hi Gilberto 1) 
   Holding ""forever""  
  I will refer you to Warren Buffett who shares this view 
 His company, Berkshire Hathaway inc.  BRK.a     and BRK.b   does not pay dividends either and he uses the term, intrinsic value to explain the concept 
 2) 
   From the instructions, from year t+3 onward, you expect the FCFs to grow at a constant yearly rate of 4% 
  Therefore, the share price price is volatile (go up, down sideways) to reflect the needs of those who buy & sell 
 The value reflects the constant 4%/yr FCF.  Benjamin Graham , the father of value investing said,  ""In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.”  Price is just what you pay. Value is what you get in return for this price 
 I am a value investor and an Investment Manager 
 I am a bit disappointed (I am biased) that more was not offered on the fundamentals of value investing 
 I do agree that all the instructors have done a tremendous job of offering valuable insight into the field of investment management and i have enjoyed reviewing this course 
 To be fair, value investing is a small minority of investment management by number of investors 
 They do hold  the majority of capital 
 Value investing requires a  high discipline and is not designed for the majority 
 Perhaps, in the future a course specific to value investing will be offered 
 Hope this helps"

 Take Uber and Lyft for example 
 While they are often mentioned in the same breath as taxi alternatives, Uber operates in far more markets than Lyft and is investing significantly into autonomous vehicles and food delivery, which has the potential for far greater returns than just ridesharing alone

 _smiley_  While it's certainly easier to use a price-to-earnings multiple based valuation, I can see how this might not be accurate 
 We're assuming that the company we are comparing the company in question to has the same exact business type (same customers, same market share, same product, etc.) which I assume would be a reasonable guess 
 But there are so many variables involved that, in reality, we'd still have to call it a guess 
 Maybe a close guess, but still a guess 
 I imagine that during market bubbles and crashes, multiple based valuation methods (thinking of P/E valuation specifically here) would be inaccurate because of the extraordinary market conditions that would differ greatly from however close we'd like to get to objective reality 
 Companies  that just reported a loss should certainly be a cause for concern and research, but do not necessarily rule them out as good long term prospects 
 Going back to 2008, it looks like virtually every company lost ground, good and bad alike 
 I think it's fair to say that some very good investment prospects have losses from time to time 
 Using a multiple based valuation during a loss would skew the answer toward a negative result, which, upon researching the past performance (and using a more detailed valuation like DCF), might indicate future prospects more positively than simply running a multiples-based evaluation during a single loss period"

5432,599,924,4,2018-11-10 15:45:30,"As we have seen, gold can serve as a hedge against extreme events that tend to hurt the performance of other assets (political tensions, stock market crashes, hyperinflation, 
 ) 
  An important characteristics of these events is that they are impossible (or very hard) to predict until it’s too late 
 So to hedge against these events, an investor would have to hold some gold at all time in his or her portfolio as an insurance, instead of waiting for the last moment when the price of gold is likely to have already shot up 
 On the other hand, we have also seen that holding gold entails an opportunity cost meaning that during periods where no extreme events take place, you miss the opportunity of making returns by investing in other financial assets (e.g 
 Stocks or bonds which are supposed to reward you over time for your invested capital) in addition to the possibility of seeing the price of gold decrease as the memories of past extreme events disappear from the minds of other investors who progressively liquidate their gold position 
 So, would you rather have a relatively large part of your portfolio invested in gold at all times as an insurance, or a relatively small part and stomach the impact that extreme events may have on traditional assets, with the conviction that these assets are ultimately the ones that will enhance your living standard because they are supposed to reward you for your invested capital"

 Also, even if we are comparing two companies that are very similar, one could still have a much large P/E ratio than another 
 For example, what if company A bought back a lot of stock to increase their EPS? Company B would have a lower EPS than A, even if financials are very similar

 I would seldom use multiple based valuation methods because so many other intangible (and therefore impossible to put a ratio on) factors such as management competency, consumer brand strength etc make a company virtually unique in terms of strength/weakness 
 When a company reported a loss in the most recent annual report, it is not the be-all indicator 
 The earnings might have been corroded by factors beyond their control, but with good management (and sometimes accounting magic), the company might maintain their ratios by cutting expenses and allowances

 In this instance one may look to historic multiples for a particular industry (such as industrials) 
  However when a new industry sector is being created (or transformed such as tech in the dotcom bubble) there is no historical basis

 However, we should not lose sight of the fact that the strength of relative valuation as a market probe is also its weakness

 During the crises they tend to undervalue companies, during “booms” they usually overvalue them 
 Moreover, when company shows negative earning one cannot apply multiples to estimate the price of a company

 Thanks for your question 
 Partly you are right 
 Since the return of bonds are fixed, if the inflation increases fast, it indeed means the negative return 
 Compared to bonds, equities are more changable, and usually if inflation increases, the stock market performs well 
 But this not always happen, take the expamle of China, where I am living 
 In the 2000s, China had serious inflation, but the stock market is totally the bear market

 The problem though is that these stricter measures and requirements have further translated into higher operating costs for banks which are either passed on to the end customers or to the workforce in the form of significant layoff plans

 What this method doesn't include is external factors that are not being factored in those simple ratios 
 For example the P/E of a company is consistently at a good shape making the company quite attractive to investors but a competitive company is coming up with a breakthrough innovation in the next quarter dominating the market share and cause huge loss of revenue to the current company which makes the stock collapsing in the next months 
 So assessing competitive environment is always key, assessing the quality of the top management of a company to understand the strategic directions and future go 2market strategies is also a key to assess the performance and consistency of a company's strategy 
 Other elements should be taken into consideration on top to the multiple based valuation methods is any factors that can affect the sales or the costs of a company's products in the future i.e an increase in raw materials for a product that is constantly growing will put pressure on company's financials and as a result this can be somehow forecasted in the calculations of an investment choice of a company's stock etc"

 However, this depends on numerous factors such as the value of products/services provided by the company, acceptability by customers, quality of products, management's ability/capability in delivering the expected earnings and finally also the market conditions in general 
 For example, when purchasing the shares/equity of a new car company and comparing it against similar successful companies, it is important to consider not such the price-to-earnings ratio but also the number of recalls due to defects 
 Huyandai motors had a poor recall ratio with 1.15 vehicles recalled for every model sold since 1986 
 It is also important to consider the price-to-earnings ratio in the real context of performance in the market over the longer term - Were the comparable companies consistent in achieving the perfomance over a signifcant period of time (which included various market conditions)

 If an investor aiming for short periods of investment and wants the capital back in short time, I think it is safe to lock a generous portion of the investment in gold 
 For long period investors,  since severe fluctuation  may not seem to be a big  threats as these types of investors can hold on to low market values for a while until the market picks up again placing a large amount of gold in the portfolio does not seem to be a good decision

 With industrialization there also came the devide between knowing production processes and not knowing about them 
 So how can valuation be right 
 One can argue when the transaction has occurred, but as bubbles might show is that information is not that efficient 
 Another aspect is the aggreation of value and price versus the individual investor who likes to push his/her value and price expectations 
 So the term efficiency might obscure complexity of reality more than that it is helpful

  However, this has not always been the case, as certain extreme cases indicate (think of the multiples of  _domain_  companies during 1999) 
  Accordingly, solely relying on multiples can lead investors astray in determining fair values, when all of a given company's comparables are overvalued 
 Multiples are often distorted by non-recurrent financial items (a one of gains, asset impairments, etc) 
  Accordingly, certain company's might enjoy non-normal multiples, that would distort our calculation of fair value if used

 In addition I believe that more can be considered to support that decision 
 At first glance, I would say that the gold should be treated as an asset and the portfolio allocation theory shall be applied 
 For instance, the Markowitz theory should be used to determine risk efficient frontier and the gold should be approached as an asset that contributes to risk reduction; it will have an negative correlation with most (or all) of the analyzed assets 
 Alternatively, the CAPM (Capital asset pricing model) could be adapted to have gold acting against the macroeconomic factor 
 This approach would determine the gold allocation by computing a CAL (capital allocation line) tangent to the efficient frontier considering the investor risk profile and a risk free asset 
 However, depending on how dramatic the situation we are trying to hedge is, even the risk free asset on such theory would have an expressive risk 
 What makes me think that an specific strategy should be developed 
 I would say that simulating worst case scenarios for the eventual “black swan” would be beneficial 
 For instance,  the investor can simulate a scenario assuming that after the “black swan” period the markets tend to recover 
 Thus, the investor could forecast what would be long term portfolio reward considering the reinvestment of the gold reserve in stocks during the market recovering 
 In conclusion, I believe that there is no deterministic answer for this question once it depends on the investor risk profile 
 However, the portfolio allocation theory and/or the development of specific strategies should be used in order to support the decision concerning the percentage of gold allocation"

 It is also important to observe the level of international business of the companies, because, not only, their own management policies can affect its results, but also countries policies where they have business or even natural disasters can affect one company and not other, so history facts can implicate on different ratios

 Inside the asset same rule is applied, only that the low-medium-high is not exactly the risk, but the return/risk ratio

 In conclusion, the government must continue its efforts to educate and create best practices awareness between the banks for implementation of corporate governance regulations and compliance culture that would make every participatory persons in the running of the banks to know the implication of noncompliance and the consequences which would sending warnings to the management and board that the government would no longer tolerate any breach of its regulations

 With the current Oil Prices that won't fix it 
 And if the Petro-Dollar system will crash, due to weak USD, and the Oil will be denominated in an other currency, it will weaken the USD even more until the US will default

  Valuation in general is a lot of guesswork 
 Even if one would average multiples of various firms in the same industry with same economic circumstances, still the spread can be tremdous - so the question still remains which one to choose and why.  Multiples depend heavily on     growth rate of the company (e.g 
 A startup company will be valued differently than a long established one) 
      size of a company (how many employees etc.)   and capital structure (how much debt) and the associated risks   These all are factors valued into the share price by shareholders therewith impacting the market value 
 So to find a real comparable firm for a solid multiple is probably just as cumbersome 
 Finally, even having found a complete one to one match, does not necessarily mean that the market values this company correctly 
 The overarching assumption here is efficient markets - that is the assumption that other companies are prices at fair value at any point in time 
 Behavioral Finance has proven otherwise 
 I personally prefer DCF. Curious to see what you think about this"

 I believe there would have been another Great Depression had the FeD not used the TARP 
 I think it is up to lawmakers and not just central banks to restrict irresponsible lending practices by banks going forward 
 But I do still think it is necessary for a central bank to be a ""lender of last resort"" to guarantee the stability of the financial system and give people confidence 
 According to the book ""a colossal failure of common sense"" which was written by a guy who worked at Lehman Brothers for 4 years until the collapse of that bank, the Bill Clinton administration encouraged US banks to lend to people that they should not have been lending to (so called ""Ninjas"", people with no income, no jobs, no assets"") 
  The US administration also repealed an act of law that was put into place after the Great Depression which seperated investment banks from commercial banks so that banks could not put depositors money at risk

 Sure, this would have caused short-term pain, but all these bailouts did was delay the inevitable

 From my point of view, the amount of intervention of the US government is always lower than the Italian one. Giving the conditions of our economy, I would not be concerned of similar policies 
 However, I imagine you require a more objective opinion 
 Well, I think that the sub-prime part of the troubled assets has been purchased in order to satisfy a political need, both democratic and republican, to experiment with a different kind of social housing

 Since know the economy has recovered, I can say just that the such aim has been expensive for non-US economies; clearly economies not of the size of the US cannot apply a similar strategy 
 My answer, thus, is that I am worried of the too liberal way the government is pursuing its democratic policies but I am not really concerned about the consequences of financial sector bailouts in other countries

5979,3421,33,4,2017-07-16 09:52:51,">What could that assumption be 
 It may be the assumption that the operational and financial risks of the company under consideration and comparable companies are the same 
 Ideally one should find several reference companies in one industry, all with the same capital value, same debt and on the same technology level, but this is barely possible, because all the companies even within the one industry are different and each of them may carry specific risk 
 Thus one has to put some conditions on the reference group of companies (e.g 
 Market cap. not bigger than 200 M and not smaller than 100 M, Debt/EBITDA < 2.0,  
 ), compute weighted average multiples over this group and hope, that this multiples will serve as an accurate enough estimate for the company under consideration 
 >Were there instances in history where you would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies 
 I think that in the case of M&A or incorporation deals the multiples may be deformed significantly (for example after the incorporation of the small company by a big company its balance value may be considered as a part of earnings of the big company) 
   >What about companies that just reported a loss (i.e 
 Negative earnings) 
   In this case one may take the multiples for the bigger time period 
 E.g 
 If a company reported a loss by the end of the year one may look on the earnings over the 5 years and consider the relevant P/E 
 Over the certain periods of time some multiples may become negative 
 My opinion is that multiples-based valuation alone is not enough because it tells us only about the past performance of a company and about the present situation, but nothing about the future prospects 
 There should be a reason why the multiples for the company differ from the average over the particular industry and a driver to eliminate this difference (end of the expensive investment program, change of the management, rise of the cost for the products of the company,  
 ) 
  One has not only to calculate the multiples but also find the reason(s) for under(over)valuation and the driver(s) for the change of the situation"

6003,1627,159,4,2017-09-16 16:59:06,"Hi 
 I believe the underlying or at least important assumption we make while using multiple-based methods is that the comparable group of companies are correctly valued by market 
 In the preceding quiz and lectures as well as evidence in real life confirms that companies may be either undervalued  or overvalued 
 If we consider, for example, oil and gas companies in emerging markets such as Russia and Ukraine where the state has almost a monopoly in the industry, the small cap privately owned oil and gas businesses cannot even find a proper peer group for comparison 
 The next important requirement for peers comparison is that the relevant group should be consistent in terms of revenue structure, business ""maturity"", debt or simply be alike 
 This constitutes another limitation for multiples based methods because  all the companies are different in their own way and normally our knowledge about them is based only on publicly awailable information 
 I understand that in this cours we are talking about companies who adhere to the same accounting and reporting standards such as IFRS , US GAAP, or other similar GAAPs (generally accepted accounting principles), while it may not always be the case as each country may have its own standards for financial disclosures 
 Hence , the definition of revenue and eventually profit shown by companies in a little known country may also be a subject for discrepancies with the peers in developed markets (countries) 
   The discussed in the course multiples based methods were based on current or past information as opposed to DCF method which takes into consideration future cash inflows and growth rates 
 That is in my opinion another disadvantage of multiples methods 
 Global demand for some products may change dramatically within industry 
 Again in energy sector the price for fossil fuel has dropped from 120 to below 50 usd/barrel (crude oil Brent) over past few years, the deplition of resources puts under going concern companies producers 
 While solar and renewables based energy companies are enjoying stronger growth and future demand (Tesla, Solaris, etc.) 
  Mobile phone companies: Nokia and Blackberry example of failures after years of significant growth couldn't serve as peers to Apple or Samsung (smartphones) while they seemed to be alike 
 And finally, the question about p/e for loss makers 
 Well, the purpose of any (commercial) firm is generating profits 
 The instinct says investing in loss making companies is a financial suicide 
 However if the company is undervalued due to its loss year, it's always worth to ask why there was a loss 
 And if the reason was adequate , the investment may be very well rewarded in the future 
 It often happens that company underwent some restructuring, was fined by regulator, posted impairment of assets or incurred a loss from discontinued operations 
 They not necessary lead to negative EBITDA but significantly lower it 
 Financial analysts and accountants call those adverse items as ""one-offs"" 
  One-offs do not typically happen in a due course of business but rather appear as ""black swans"" 
  In this case excluding one - offs from EBITDA or in other words -normalizing EBITDA-  may give us another more accurate picture on the value of the company

6009,43,267,4,2016-02-18 14:04:18,"Hi Naila, The following Wikipedia article may help you understand the mathematical derivation of the Terminal Value formula and how the constant growth rate ""g"" ends up at the denominator of the Terminal Value (you can replace ""dividend"" by ""free cash flow"" so that it applies to the DCF model) :     The Terminal Value is basically an infinite sum of future cash flows 
 The mathematical derivation linked above shows you how this infinite sum can be simplified to the expression for the Terminal Value we have seen in the course 
 This simplification relies on the (strong) assumption that the WACC (r) and Constant Growth rate (g) are constant and know in advance 
 This is actually the reason why we make these big assumptions: it reduces an infinite sum of very hard to predict cash flows into a simple fraction which is far easier to manipulate 
 I hope this helps 
 Best regards, Jonas"

 Nevertheless it's opportunity costs means that during normal periods it's not an asset that generates important rewards 
 The answer to this question depends, in my opinion, to what kind of investor/manager are you. If you're an active manager who aims to beat the market you'll need to incur in higher risk investments 
 That will mean that a smaller amount of gold will be part of your portfolio, just enough to stomach the impact of this black swan, meaning that the losses you'll make in stocks, bonds and other assets will be mitigated by the profits made in gold 
 If, on the counterpart, you are an index manager or a cautious investor you'll have a relatively large part of your portfolio invested in gold, meaning that a smaller part of your portfolio will be allocated to high return investments, but you'll be safer protected against black swans with a larger percentage of gold in your asset allocation 
 Personally if we consider a 5% lose to your invested portfolio and we consider 50% rise of gold in a crisis situation (let's forget about all the imponderables like inflation, market fluctuation ETC) I would say would be wise to have between a 10 and 15% of your portfolio allocated to gold in order to reduce your losses to half at least"

 In addition, I have checked the glossary provided in the introductory lesson material; certainly these are more reliable than my personal understanding 
 Please see below 
 1 – According to Reuters Glossary: “The possibility that an investment or venture will make a loss or not make the returns expected 
 There are many different types of risk including basis risk, country or sovereign risk, credit risk, currency risk, economic risk, inflation risk, liquidity risk, market or systemic risk, political risk, settlement risk and translation risk.” 
  2 – According to Yahoo Glossary: “According to modern investment theory, the greater the risk you take in making an investment, the greater your return has the potential to be if the investment succeeds 
 For example, investing in a startup company carries substantial risk, since there is no guarantee that it will be profitable 
 But if it is, you’re in a position to realize a greater gain than if you had invested a similar amount in an already established company 
 As a rule of thumb, if you are unwilling to take at least some investment risk, you are likely to limit your investment return 
 For example, if you put your money into an insured bank deposit, which protects your principal, your real rate of return is unlikely to exceed inflation over an extended period.”"

 Banks are fundamental to the financial system as well as the economy 
 Their business largely depends on the trust of investors and depositors 
 Thus, in times of financial turbulence, if the depositors lose trust and believe a bank is on the verge of bankruptcy, the risk of a potential bank run is high 
 Also it could lead to mistrust among the banks and the interbank financial system could freeze as we see in the 2008/09 crisis 
 A freeze will raise serious problems for banks since a main function of a bank is to transform short term debt to long term credit 
 This maturity transformation could be seriously impaired in times of soaring or even unavailable interbank lending 
 In short, even though there are compelling arguments for NOT bailing out banks, e.g 
 The belief of ""too-big-too-fail"" could generate high incentive for banks to be careless in future and give out more subprime loans, I believe it is necessary for government to give guarantees to potentially failing banks in order to ensure the trust of depositors and investors, as well as to prevent large spillover of the damage from one bank to others"

 It was a major global crisis with painful consequences and I do not feel that are fully recovered yet. The bailout of banks was necessary to get the economy moving again and encourage bank to start lending at a level that will increase investment 
 The process vary from bank to bank, they do not have the same level of confidence and given the experience they have been through they learned to act more cautious 
 After all they also experienced major losses, a couple of them (Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers), vanished from the market like never existed, so I guess that was also a lesson to be learned the hard way for the remaining banks that no matter who you are or how powerful you might be you can be either bought or go bankrupt if you do not have your finances in order 
 There is no such thing like ""too big to fail"" although those which were considered that way if they went out of business we could have had a real depression and not a major recession 
 So, US government did the right thing and I do not think that banks assumed that that bailout will happen too soon assuming another recession is just around the corner 
 The vast majority of banks, business and investors play more prudently now and have a big cushion of (cash) reserves to be covered for the foreseeable future

 In addition to internal equilibrium, macroeconomic equilibrium is also an important consideration 
 For example, a change in the macroeconomic climate could severely affect a firm's profitability and can therefore change the firm's value from a multiplier perspective 
 Summarily, it is important to use financial tools in a way that not only preserves the model's integrity, but also in a way that appropriately accounts for possible changes to future earning potential 
 It is therefore critical to consider equilibrium during security valuation"

 If a new company went public and came to market at this time and you valued it based on the multiples the market was assigning to other similar companies, your valuation was likely to be shown incorrect after the valuations of many of these companies fell 
 (Source: Quora) 2 
 A multiple is a distillation of a great deal of information into a single number or series of numbers 
 By combining many value drivers into a point estimate, multiples may make it difficult to disaggregate the effect of different drivers, such as growth, on value 
 The danger is that this encourages simplistic, and possibly erroneous, interpretation 
 The use of industry averages overlooks the fact that companies, even in the same industry, can have drastically different expected growth rates, returns on invested capital, and capital structures 
 (Source: Wikipedia) 3 
 P/E multiples have two major flaws 
 First, they are systematically affected by capital structure 
 For companies whose unleveraged P/E (the ratio they would have if entirely financed by equity) is greater than one over the cost of debt, P/E ratios rise with leverage 
 Thus, a company with a relatively high all-equity P/E can artificially increase its P/E ratio by swapping debt for equity 
 Second, the P/E ratio is based on earnings, which include many non-operating items, such as restructuring charges and write-offs 
 Since these are often one-time events, multiples based on P/Es can be misleading

 In this case, the old bonds will have less value as they offer less yield compared to the new bonds issued by the government 
 As a consequence, the owners of these old bonds must sell their bonds at a price which is cheaper than the price of the new bonds 
 Hence, the average price of the bond decreases 
 On the other hand, when the yield to maturity increases, the owners of the old bonds can sell their bonds at a premium as their bonds offer more yield than the new bonds issued by the government 
 Hence, the average price of the bond increases 
 One thing to note is that old bonds on the market should have shorter time until maturity compared to new bonds as a certain amount of time has passed since the old bonds were bought

 In practice, however, quantitative easing has traditionally focused on buying longer-term government bonds from banks 
 The idea is twofold: first, sovereign yields serve as a benchmark for pricing riskier privately issued securities 
 When long-term government bonds are purchased, the yields on privately issued securities are expected to decline in parallel with those on government bonds

 Answers to Q3:                                \rThe basic problem with valuing firms with negative earnings is that projections cannot be based upon a base number that is negative 
 There are three options available to an analyst valuing a firm with negative earnings.\r\n • Normalize Earnings: In this approach, we replace the current earnings that are negative with a “normalized earnings” that is positive 
 Clearly, this approach pre-supposes that the negative earnings in the current year is an aberration and that the firm will revert back to positive earnings in a normal year.\rRevenues and Margins: The second approach is to base projections on revenues, which should never be negative, and estimate operating or net margins over time 
 As the financial health of the firm improves, the margins should increase from the current levels (which are negative) to a more sustainable positive number 
 The projected revenues, in conjunction with the margins, can be used to estimate earnings 
 Once earnings turn positive and margins stabilize, valuation becomes more routine 
 An alternative and related approach is to estimate capital invested for future years and returns on capital over time, to arrive at estimates of earnings in future periods.\r\n • Reduce Leverage: In the special case where a firm reports negative equity earnings because it has too much debt, and not because it has operating problems, the simplest way to adjust earnings over time is to reduce the leverage of the firm 
 As the firm operations grow over time, and financing charges are lowered (as leverage is reduced), the equity earnings will become positive.\r"

 It doesn't matter if the company id publicly traded or not or if it is soon going to be (in the case of an IPO) 
   We used the example of a privately held firm because it is a case where the shares of a company have a value (the company generate profits that are split between shareholders) but they are not traded on an exchange (because it is held privately) so you cannot rely on a market price to find an estimate of the value of the shares 
 Therefore, you have to find a way to compute the value of the shares of this company on your own. And this is where the valuation methods we presented can hep you. If the company is already traded on an exchange (that is, investors buy and sell shares of this company to each other and you can observe the transaction prices), then you can use the valuation methods your learned in the course to try to determine if it is undervalued or overvalued and thus find potential investment opportunities 
 I hope this helps 
 Bets regards, Jonas"

 Also, we assume that the market values an entire industry properly, which could lead to errors if the latter is over/undervalued 
 In this sense, the  _domain_  bubble in the late 1990s/early 2000s is a good example of a market valuation of a sector gone wrong, with investors buying stock of overvalued IT companies because they belonged to a presumed high growth industry

 In the UK, I am concerned that the bail-outs resulted in a concentration of the banking sector and so we faced with the risks that we have banks that are ""too big to fail"" and a decrease in competition

 Something had to be done to address this issue and governments could not stand aside and say it's not our place to intervene while the economy collapsed, when there was something they could have done to reduce the pressure or slow the problem 
 However, as a result we can see that banks who profited from years of negligence found in the central banks someone to foot the bill for their irresponsible behavior 
 In general, governments were correct to bailout and put out the fire but concurrently needed to put in measures to prevent such irresponsible activity from recurring, to give an incentive to banks that if they behave recklessly again, the consequences for the individuals involved will be severe"

 From my point of view, there is usually another assumption for doing valuation by comparables, those methods don't use historical data to analyse the scenarios while it does not happen with absolute valuation models like DCF. Other interesting aspects about multiples-based valuation methods, they are not usually meaningful to valuate negative earnings because we cannot comparable a company with poor prospects to another with good prospects 
 In these cases, we can use price / sales multiples because a company often has positive sales 
 Unfortunately, there is no one method that is perfect for all situations 
 Each company or equity or bond or share are different, and each one has unique aspects and characteristics demand different approaches 
 I suppose, a good alternative is to use different methods to valuate something : absolute valuation models valuate the aspects of the company itself, and multiples-based valuation methods compare that company to other similar companies"

 Earnings put back into the company increase its value 
 Dividends paid out decrease the company's value 
 Increased company value will increase the stock price 
 Companies use these retained earnings to buy new machinery, buildings, research and development , buying other companies,etc.  This is how Apple and Google got to where they are.

 In fact, Themis Themistocleus, one of our guest speakers from UBS, put it in the following words:  ""But you have to understand discounted cash flow makes a lot of assumptions over many years 
 People find it very cumbersome and it's also prone to mistakes 
 So they tend to take shortcuts, they tend to take simpler valuation methodologies like price to earnings, cash flow yield, dividend yield, to get an answer to what the fair value is.""   There is however a very important assumption we make when we use ratios we observe on the market (like price-to-earnings) to value other comparable companies 
 What could that assumption be 
 Were there instances in history where you would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies 
 What about companies that just reported a loss (i.e 
 Negative earnings)"
6459,976,241,4,2018-01-07 07:55:12,"The companies we use as bench mark must have the same operating characteristics,ie must be in similiar industries and in the same growth phase 
 The financial crisis, tech bubble burst are instances in history where application of mutltiple -based valuation methods of company valuation has proved very disasterous"
6460,1087,67,4,2018-09-01 08:52:42,"Holding about 10% of my portfolio as investment in gold seems sensible for me 
 As the opportunity cost is well covered by the other investments , as well as it provides a minimum hedge in case of a black swan situation"
6461,3564,361,4,2017-06-22 06:51:25,"Given the unlikely situation, a 10% investment in gold should be fine"
6462,2551,117,4,2016-06-06 22:13:35,"I think that it was pretty much necessary for the US government to bailout its financial sector , because in the end that's what helped the economy to recover faster from the crisis"
6463,89,962,4,2016-03-13 23:40:36,"I belive this has to do with the expectation on returns on equity, so, stocks can have greater returns (with greater volatility), than bonds, so in general or in theory it can be expected to find the currency volatility to have higher impact over the bonds that in general have less volatile or more stable expected returns 
 If this is right this days may be showing how currency volatility may also have impact in equities returns in EM's 
 Hope anyone from the staff clarify this 
 Best regards"
6464,1887,192,4,2016-09-05 02:56:50,"I think after the bailout the banks will be more careful when lending money in the future 
 This will maybe result in slower economic growth but al least it will be more stable"
6465,1295,605,4,2016-12-06 09:17:12,"I think the central banks were faced with a crisis of confidence that was so large that they were obliged to act decisively 
 In doing so they didn't have the benefit of knowing how it all was going to turn out.  They have clearly prevented a repeat of the great Depression 
 They are now faced with the problem of how to unwind the excess of liquidity that they have pumped into the system 
 Better that, than to have had to answer the criticism of why they did too little"
6466,23,107,4,2017-09-10 06:42:07,"I think the decision was wise but it also does involve political backing and lobbying 
 It does help banks and do give them the leverage of repeating the same mistake in the future 
 But on the other hand, if compare to Europe, it has helped US to speedily recover from these crisis"
6467,2068,347,4,2017-09-29 07:30:28,"Market participants are proved to not behave rationally always, so price in P/E ratio rare reflects the true financial and ""market"" state of the company 
 Moreover, when observing bubbles of different kind, we can also see that most of multiples go crazy and never depict the true picture not only of the companies standalone, but of the sector as a whole 
 When companies report a loss, one is supposed to use other multiples that do not include earnings"
6468,1589,846,4,2018-07-18 14:47:54,"I do believe that the US government's bailout of our financial sector was necessary, however I think we needed to put more responsibility on those who carelessly invested or made huge returns hedging these careless investments 
 Our financial fraud laws need to be enforced more strictly in order to ensure that the problems we faced during the financial crisis do not happen again"
6469,3565,192,4,2016-08-12 13:51:59,I think we would have had a better recovery if governments did not interfere with global economic crisis
6470,3566,34,4,2016-03-18 17:55:14,"I think it's necessary 
 There might be potential consequences of this bailout, but comparing with the potential consequence of NOT bailout,  I think the US government has just chosen the ""less bad"" side"
6471,2462,117,4,2016-06-04 09:01:22,"I believe that the bailout of banks by certain goverments were necessary since acting diffrently would have a huge negative impact in the market 
 In order to discourange banks in considering these actions as a ""bad example"" for their operation, maybe much more tighten regulations and auditing should be imposed"
6472,2885,44,4,2016-04-17 17:43:02,"The assumption is that the market cap value is accurate 
 The latest instances where I wouldn't feel comfortable using multiple valuation methods are the tech bubble crisis and the sub prime crises where multiples were over valued 
 In case of a loss the multiple methods can't be used"
6473,1480,632,4,2017-10-20 01:47:42,Bad incentive
6474,2152,46,4,2017-03-12 15:23:02,"I think that the bailout of financial sector was necessary to avoid a greatest financial catastrophe, however it is important that governments and central banks force banking system to be more prudential about their risks and to fine heavily that ones who not respect the rules"
6475,3226,262,4,2018-03-16 12:53:36,"I guess there are many assumptions: one of them is that the information is correct, something that can't always be taken for granted 
 The other, that the earnings of a company in a given year is truly representative of its real situation and prospective earnings in the future"
6476,3297,301,4,2017-09-19 17:24:10,I would allocate 30 percent of my investments to gold
6477,3186,195,4,2018-08-10 13:53:37,"At this time I do not have an investment philosophy outlined, but i can say that a slow and steady approach would be wiser 
 That being said, I would have gold in my portfolio, would need to study more the actual amount"
6478,843,246,4,2017-01-19 19:16:47,"Smaller hedge inceasing with major non-traditional events (BREXIT, TRUMP, 
 )"
6479,844,997,4,2017-07-21 02:39:05,"In the second example, the initial investment was positive $100. How can an initial investment in which we are spending money a positive inflow and not a negative outflow, since we are spending it in order to invest in the project"
6480,1350,29,4,2016-07-05 08:38:29,"When we use ratios we observe on the market the assumption we make is that companies are trading at faire value, which in reality they don't do I never had an experience involving multiple-based valuation methods to value companies, but I think that this method can't really be applied in reality 
 It's possible that companies reporting a loss are manipulating their accounts in order to pay less taxes 
 It could just be a virtual loss 
 Those methods aren't necessarily illegal; those companies generally uses weaknesses in the law to optimize tax"
6481,2097,530,4,2018-10-21 19:14:49,I would keep a small prat of my investment in gold
6482,3567,150,4,2016-03-24 11:23:32,"Seems like you would want a rather large part of your portfolio invested in gold at all times 
 What are the downsides to this"
6483,3331,18,4,2016-02-21 15:57:53,Some multiples like EBITDA are non-GAAP which may be misleading for the investors and that could lead to a wrong judgement or a company's reality
6484,2527,150,4,2016-03-27 04:08:10,"I would invest a relatively small part of my portfolio in gold due to the fact that my other investments would also be on the low risk scale 
 I also do not see too many black swan events happening in the future, although I would keep a certain portion of my portfolio invested in gold in case this would happen"
6485,2520,998,4,2017-07-21 02:53:30,"My name is usually a mouthful for most and so I go by Tara

6486,3568,364,4,2018-03-19 15:06:39,\n\nmore worried about the potential consequences of this bailout in terms of bad incentives for banks
6487,273,192,4,2016-09-10 07:25:23,"I think we need to think about the potential consequences of this bailout 
 The government just put the bandage on the wound 
 Two things can happen from this situation either the wound will heal itself or it will become a more serious issue"
6488,2250,686,4,2017-11-27 12:15:16,"I believe it was good step but it is necessary to consider possible consequences 
 From one point of view they recovered faster after the crisis but it also sends signal to the banks that they can run riskier policies because government will back them up during the crisis if situation turns out to be in serious trouble 
 Banks should know that this step wont be repeated"
6489,374,441,4,2018-04-27 21:32:05,Depending on several circumstances which impact the overall market stability and carefully studying the past recent performance different asset classes

6491,1519,43,4,2018-05-02 16:43:11,"The DCF valuation method is only one of the methods available to evaluate companies / stocks 
 Unfortunately the numbers presented by this method are not enough to evaluate the situation of the company at the moment, we can mention Nokia 
 A company that was centenarian and that was languishing until arriving in the bankruptcy 
 The investor has to have a sense of assessment for how the market is, what are threats and opportunities, and so on"
6492,3569,161,4,2017-11-30 00:34:28,"I think such bailout method should be the last resort to save the economic 
 If the central back overuse it,  the market will become numb and not respond to it positively 
 Furthermore, it is unfair to use the tax we paid to save those poor-performed banks"
6493,3570,85,4,2017-07-09 15:43:42,"The assumptions are various 
 For example, the selected firms should be comparable firms in the same industry, with similar risks, in similar stage of development, thus the similar expected growth rate 
 In history, for example, in 1932, the price to earnings ratio was rather high, although the stock market was then rather weak 
 The ratio can also be negative, when companies report losses 
 In this case, it means that companies have negative earnings"
6494,3571,462,4,2018-10-28 16:30:55,"It is important to put gold at medium stake in portfolio because it increases the value if you store in bank with a opportunity cost 
 However,If there is political tension,stock market crashes or anything happens it does not affect much"

6496,916,134,4,2016-03-04 13:21:52,"I think this assumption may be that the comparable companies have the same spendings and may incur the same losses which may not be the case 
 In my opinion the companies that just reported a loss should be analyzed using more ratios"
6497,3572,7,4,2016-03-18 13:29:14,"Assumptions that can be made using ratios to observe market is that all companies are equal this may not be true because of several reasons such as product in development that may not be out on the market yet thus not producing income that would be used in a ratio such as price-to-earnings 
 Multiple-based valuation may not have been ideal in recessionary periods such as the GFC if you were to compare banks they may have all been similar but all would have been in some financial stress, this could have lead to an unfair valuation"
6498,2481,97,4,2016-07-28 08:47:37,"I would prefer a relatively small percentage of my portfolio in Gold because when black swan events occur and stock markets crash, its usually for a short period of time 
 Markets tend to recover relatively quickly 
 However, i beleive this is a subjective question in that it depends on the risk appetite of the individual investor, their age, goals, personal circumstances etc 
 So if an investor is close to retirement age, they should probably have a greater proportion / percentage of their portfolio in Gold compared to a younger person who would have more time to wait for his portfolio to recover in the event of a black swan /stock market crash or hyper inflation."
6499,2699,731,4,2017-03-26 21:12:35,"Because company shares value compared by the multiples-based valuation method can be heavily affected by external factor such as macroeconomic conditions, governments policy and decisions, and technical factors"
6500,549,566,4,2017-04-15 14:43:31,"If you have a well diversified portfolio, consisting of global equities, bonds and real estate, only about 5% of portfolio may be in gold 
 Enough to take care of emergencies during crises or black swans 
 Treat it more like insurance 
 Not a way to make money with very low probability events"

6503,3001,22,4,2016-02-23 20:03:39,"Actually it depends on your risk appetite and gold as anchor could be used  to balance average risk of your portfolio 
 E.g 
 A lii;e part of gold with big part of investments in bonds and equities of developed markets , and vice versa for emerging markets"
6504,1637,131,4,2017-06-09 04:56:33,"We assume that the market is efficient 
 There were instances when the market was volatile and ever changing and i felt that that the market price was not at all reflective of the actual market price and the price kept changing without any change in the underlying company fundamentals"
6505,2619,118,4,2018-03-15 14:07:38,"Because gold is so hard to store, I think I would probably invest 1/8th of my assets into gold"
6506,1781,502,4,2017-08-13 21:54:08,"A higher or lower ratio can have very different causes, a high ratio can for example mean that growth is expected or risk is low. Is higher or lower better 
 Is the risk correctly assessed 
 Is high growth to be expected"
6507,353,174,4,2017-05-28 00:15:15,I'd take a barbell approach and shoulder a good amount of portfolio in gold and a small amount of assets in highly speculative but potentially highly lucrative investments
6508,1652,328,4,2017-09-23 20:21:16,"I do not believe in a perfect economic system and for me any economy can have a systemic fault within itself 
 ""Invisible hand"" that governs the markets can also create problems for the markets and I do not think  that they should be left still uncheck if the economic crisis goes catastrophic 
 If we have a concept like ""too big to fail"" already, it is not much if the government purchases assets in a time of emergency to reactivate the capital flow 
 At the end, hard times demand hard measures 
 Yet, there is this dilemma in the economic system 
 In a system where the big institutions tend to get bigger, more people depend on their existence as their gravity increases everywhere in the market 
 At that point, employment, investment, economic growth and production depend too much on them, hence governments cannot ignore their fall 
 Yet, in a free market, governments cannot intervene with their operations in order to curb their profits, growths or investment 
 At the end, most of the things depend on the central banks and such government measures as mentioned in the title 
 I see it in this way: should governments do something when private sector needs support or should they left to go through a natural selection or the survival of the fittest"

6510,1293,284,4,2018-03-23 00:27:22,"The assumption is that the share price of a company is reasonably close to its real value 
 However, that is often quite a presumptuous assumption, as there is no shortage of market factors influencing share prices regardless of the actual value of a company 
 This is mainly true in extreme market rallies based on over-enthusiasm of investors, a.k.a 
 Bubbles (historical examples include dot-com bubble at the verge of the 21st century and more recent housing bubble) 
  In such cases the prices dictated by market are often closer to the clouds than to the real value of the shares 
 Thus using multiple-based valuation in such times may not be advised 
 The same goes for the subsequent market crashes, although the tables are flipped - investors panic and rush to their brokers, trying to liquidate their whole portfolios, thus driving the prices through the ground and bellow 
 Which in turn causes majority  of stocks being severely undervalued, so any share prices calculated using multiple-based valuation will cause you way more anxiety than is actually necessary 
 But even in orderly market conditions, there are some companies that seem to be unconcerned by such measly things as P/E ratio and actual value of company 
 A good example of this is TESLA 
 The company is turning negative earnings since one can remember, yet investors continue to happily throw money at it 
 This is because they believe in Elon Musk's vision, or more precisely, in profitability of his vision in the future, which will greatly offset any losses incurred until then 
 All things said though, in normal circumstances different valuation methods including multiple-based valuation are still essential tool in tactical asset allocation"
6511,1561,33,4,2017-07-15 14:39:41,"When we use PE ratio, we assume the following; - the participants of our comparable peer set; they may not be an exact match for our Company  
  They may not be in the same stage of development as our company is 
 They may not have the same financial risk as our company 
 This assumption is crucial when we make a peer set.  When the price is of a company is not being traded at the Stock Exchange on rational basis, or rather on pure sentiment, the PE multiple derived may not represent the true picture and thus this may result in an overestimated valuation 
 One needs to see the logical reasons to understand that if a company is being traded at a higher/Lower  multiple than in other times what is making the price soar/ down 
 If a Company reported a negative earning, one should see the cause of the negative earning and check whether there were any extraordinary losses or expenses 
 For Valuation, one could pick up other earning form such as EBITDA or PBT"
6512,3575,310,4,2016-10-22 20:14:03,The amount of gold in a portfolio could be managed dynamically through the time and would be used as a hedge against some unlike events
6513,649,84,4,2016-12-28 16:43:32,"I would hold a small amount only for diversification purposes 
 The percentage of the portfolio that will be in gold depends on the current situation and the evaluation/overview of the market that I have positions in 
 For example if the market looks bearish I might increase the this small percentage of gold 
 For bullish markets the opposite 
 Another idea is to use funds that have positions in gold or metals reducing the costs for holding and storing gold"

6515,3576,22,4,2016-02-16 17:18:24,"There are several problems with gold as an investment:   Gold goes not have an internal rate of return as such so I do not consider it to be an investment 
 There are transaction and storage costs associated with owning gold 
 These costs work against the assets returns to the investor 
 Historically, gold has not kept pace with the American equity markets 
 In fact the US stock market has outperformed gold by orders of magnitude over the last two hundred years 
 For these reasons, I only own enough gold to carry me through a short period of market turbulence

 There are officials commentators who are worried about it that when the next financial crisis comes, the Fed will have less power to support and strugle against the financial system from the failure of a single large bank 
 But in so doing, after the Lehman debacle, Congress curbed the Fed’s ability to rescue a bank in trouble 
 We have to be warned about the playbook of the Fed and how the market behaviour is going to react 
 \nThe primary mandate for a central bank has is to achieve stability, and if this CB interferes with monetary policy, he must consider, what are their tools that he will be used to monitor changes in the market response

 Therefore, Gold needs to be allocated as a part of the portfolio to ensure balance 
 I would say based on the type of portfolio i.e 
 If it's more equity focused or more bond focused, this allocation can vary 
 Ignoring to go in deep, approx 
 10% -15% allocation provides hedge against inflation and as market events become more volatile, this percentage can be increased whilst reducing exposure in other asset classes"

 When it occurs, using the multiples-based valuation methods probably could cause to valuate equities above their real value because of the market behavior 
 Even political decisions that reflects in the equities prices for short periods can make the multiples-based valuation methods to not reflect the reality, because in a long-term negotiation it will result probably in a loss (if you undervalued or overvalued the company), because the investor take action not knowing the real price of the company 
 So the multiples-based valuation method could result in a chain reaction where assuming that the others companies listed are fair-valued could not be true 
 Probably the multiples are better for short term investments but kind of risky, but also's good method if negotiating in regular conditions"

 In my opinion, another reason not to use comparables is that the market´s assumptions and forecasts (on FCF, WACC and growth rate) may be different from your own, giving you a valuation that might no be in line with your view of the company´s proyections 
 If a company just reported a loss, using P/E ratio comparable would give you a negative valuation

6608,3612,7,4,2016-03-08 21:37:57,"The assumption is that markets always value companies fairly and/ or efficiently 
 But markets are driven by an underlying and ever changing behavioural psychology; a herd or crowd instinct 
 For example, prices were increasing exponentially leading up to the market crash of October 1987 
 The P/E multiples were getting very high, triple digit figures in many cases, which was way above historical trends 
 Then panic set in and everyone started selling, driving stock prices down very quickly 
 So, although a PE ratio of a company may have seemed low compared to similar companies, if those other companies were in ""irrational exuberance"" territory, then comparing multiples was not the only aspect that should have been used in isolation to determine fair value of stocks 
 A company may report a loss, as companies often do, but this could be for any of a number of reasons which shouldn't be used in isolation 
 For example, it could be a start up company where costs have been high to get started; it could be that the company has experienced positive earnings and growth for a number of years but has undertaken a major and costly project to invest for the future; it may be due to temporary macro economic factors or other legitimate (and temporary) reasons 
 So negative earnings for a period is not necessarily bad - one needs to look at the underlying causes 
 Of course, it doesn't mean it's good either 
 The negative earnings could be the start of a downward demise of the company 
 Maybe there's been a change in management; a change in the business model, a change in macro economic conditions which are unfavourable; an industry wide problem, or some other condition adversely affecting earnings"

 Multiples are not a good option for firms with different lines of businesses (like conglomerates), in such cases the process to compute each line of business separately and establish a weight for each one may prove to be too inaccurate (or maybe the PE for finance firms should be used, for example) 
  If the management change the industry of the firm, for instance from telecommunications to finance, clearly the PE of the industry and the valuation are no more valid but financial statements may not correctly represent costs and earnings 
 One can account  for negative earnings computing averages on 1-3 years, thus obtaining and average price on that time 
 Fair value is generally dependent on a number of factors, combining all such factors together may point to an adjustment to multiples or to other factors that may lead to the correct valuation

 Anyway, since you are asking about negative earnings, probably the expected answer is that price to earnings ratio is even less reliable in years of economic downturn, when companies are enduring losses"

 The reason I feel 25% would be the perfect figure is because it is a vary rare event where all the markets crash at once (real estate, equity, bonds, currency, etc) so 25% would be more than sufficient to back the losses in the other assets 
 Incase an event occurs where all the markets do crash at once, gold would be easy to liquidate with the rise in price and demand for it, if at all necessary"

 Companies also incur different activities such as restructuring and management change, which may cause abnormal effects on earnings 
 Different economic and political situations also contribute uncertainty 
 Therefore we should not only use multiple based method 
 Instead we should use ""diversified"" methods including different multiples and DCF and perhaps even IRR. Looking at and comparing the results from different methods and analyzing the reasons behind the differences will provide more information to help us make the better decisions"

 On the other hand, a larger portfolio investment can be diverted to owning gold in cases where the investor is risk sensitive or is willing to stay in the market for a short period of time"

 However with quantitative easing in the horizon, there is certainly backings on owning gold which is fixed in quantity would be a more valuable asset to hold besides the hedging purposes it already serves

 Firstly as said above it would stomach the blow to my losses within the assets market, meaning that i wouldn't lose all my money and that i will live to see another day. Also due to me having a diversified portfolio not just in gold but in property, cash, stock, and  bonds, this would mean i have more of a chance of losing less as the problems within each market may not be as bad as the other 
 I also believe that confining most of my money in gold would mean that i am holding myself back as stock market crashes are happening on average every 3-5 years and right now were pushing 8-9 years and still no market crash, telling me that if i did invest in gold within a large part of my portfolio i would of wasted 8-9 years of potentially higher returns through other assets which i could of invested in 
 For all we know the economies around the world my be maturing more and the risks of market problems may slowly becoming less riskier meaning gold won't be of much value as it once use to be within our portfolio

 When system is in crises, it is important to stabilize the system first than normalize it so it was interest of Government to take over bad assets by infusing fresh capital 
 Liquidity is whole system was drying up like Ice-cream on sunny day, it was important to restore liquidity to TARP 
 Bad Incentive:-   There has to system in place to check excessive risks taken by Banks, where in concept of Moral hazard: Heads I win & tails i don't loose has to be looked in to

 Individuals sometimes have finite resources (unless you are a private banking client with access to facilities)

 More than 10% would bear too much opportunity cost 
 Also it depends on in which economic area you are located to decide how much gold is suitable for your portfolio, since you might certainly allocate more in gold and other ""safe havens"" when you are in an economically unstable area in which the currency is highly volatile or even on the verge of collapse

6704,3641,37,4,2018-01-29 03:59:45,"Firstly, whether US government's (and others around the world) bailouts of its financial sector was simply necessary for the well-being of the economy as a whole or not. The answer is it depends from aspects you are looking at it 
 From the banks' perspective, it was great support 
 Bankers took numerous risky bets, created significant risks through expanded use of derivatives and further boosting of those risks with liquidity 
 They played with a fire got burned but were lucky to receive an ambulance support that healed the wound and told them it was ""OK"" to play with fire, which in turn would/could incentivize the bank to play more 
 The question comes how long will they be able to play with fire and how long and how often Central Banks could/would act as lender of last resort 
 From the government' perspective, they had to step in otherwise the consequences is that panic and losses would have been taken onto the streets and bloodshed would have followed similar to the Asian financial crisis of 1997 (e.g 
 Seoul, Indonesia, Thailand, etc.) 
  Given the intertwinedness of the global markets, chaos in one market and region could have easily escalated and expanded to other regions and markets 
 So if a choice between stability and peace (albeit temporarily over the next several years) at a taxpayers' money vs 
 Immediate chaos and bloodshed and country destabilization 
 Governments would choose the former 
 Also one need to keep in mind that central bank roles are for finite period of time, hence, they may have some time limitations 
 More of let me take of this issue at hand with all the means there are, and then the consequential spillover effects would be my successor's problem 
 Having said, any parties involved (financial institutions, governments, central banks, ordinary citizens) should be worrying about the real cost and prospective consequences of 2007-2008 bailouts 
 Governments/regulations have to take actionable, measurable steps towards reduction of systematic risks, reduction in application and use of derivatives, breaking down large financial institutions in a smaller players that could be managed relatively easier (e.g 
 Separating specific risks and where required conducting selective liquidation and shut down institutions with bad debts)"
6705,3642,159,4,2017-09-17 21:33:05,"A key assumption is that the companies you compare to are themselves at fair value 
 Companies in the same sector may as a group be over- or undervalued e.g 
 Tech bubble where technology and telecoms firms became over valued 
 Using this approach, you would have likely calculated that a particular tech firm was approximately fair value, when in fact the sector as a whole was massively over valued 
 When there is a large amount of speculation in a particular sector about future growth, the results of this method should therefore be taken with caution 
 \nUsing negative earnings in this method gives a negative fair value, which is illogical given a firm has limited liabilities, thus can not loose an investor more than what they invest, making the minimum firm value zero 
 \n\n This method also assumes that revenues or EBITDA are representative of the overall performance of the business 
 There may be large one-off large costs (e.g 
 Restructuring, fines) or one-off sources of revenues (e.g 
 Sale of a division of the firm) which affect headline profits while underlying profits which is more representative of long-term outlook give a different picture of relative performance compared to its peers 
 An unexpected change in macroeconomic conditions (e.g 
 Sudden recession) will also affect fair value, not taken into account when looking at past profits"
6706,2745,423,4,2017-03-27 19:56:47,"The assumptions are based on similar sector of companies, company sizes, management styles etc. I therefore would not be comfortable in multiple-based valuations but will use as second reference"

 Dotcom (2000-2002) and housing (2007 -2009) market bubbles are the more recent examples of a period where related companies where dangerously overpriced before market collapse 
 Reporting a single loss doesn’t mean the company is not healthy, its performance should be instead considered in the long term 
 Figures of a company experiencing a single negative event shouldn’t be used as a reference to evaluate another one"

 However, at the same time, I am worried about the downside of bailout 
 ""To big to fail"" precisely describes this kind of shortcoming, which means that big financial institutions are almost unlikely to bankrupt because of government's bailout 
 As a result, banks have less incentives to improve the economy, because they know they will not fail no matter whether they run well or run badly"

 Yes when there are companies trading at very high P/E ratios during the  _domain_  bubble some companies were trading at 100 times PE ratio 
 Using other valuation methods would have exposed the over valuation in this case 
 This method does not allow to look at the complete valuation of a firm, taking into consideration long term perspective of growth, quality of management, competitive landscape, capital structures and many other variables that could influence an equities share price 
 When companies report a loss, investors shy away from them and the PE could be trading lower then peers and might be attractive because of this

 BP after the deep-water horizon incident would be a good example where they faced a unique set of circumstances which other similar IOCs would not have faced 
 A P/E ratio would not have been able to account for potential future punitive charges the company had to pay. If for instance such a one-off event had caused a negative earnings report, it would be hard to use a P/E ratio"

 Though, personally, I have not felt comfortable using the DCF method to value companies as it requires a great deal of forecasting as to the future free cash flows of a particular company and may even prove to be ineffective in the long-run as market conditions may dramatically change between now and the time in which we move out of our investments, a great deal of which we simply cannot predict 
 To quote Third Avenue Chief Investment Officer Curtis Jensen, using the DCF method to value companies is like using the Hubble space telescope 
 When it is moved a fraction of an inch, you view an entirely different galaxy, and it is the same for the DCF method for valuing companies, different assumptions which may only vary slightly have a dramatic effect in determining the fair value of the company

 It could be time consuming but deeply understanding these relevant issues and factoring all this info into their valuation can be a more specific a thorough approach to have a better shot at their valuation 
 Obviously the leadership of every company is different and having a top executive team managing a firm and understanding the way they are steering a firm and the premises they´re taking to offer guidance into the future of their business and the discipline in the execution is also an important factor in correctly valuating a company

 A deep and prolonged\nrecession, a very plausible outcome of the government’s refusal to intervene,\nwas clearly an unacceptable alternative due to the misery it would invoke to\nmasses of people for an indefinite period of time 
 On the other hand the critics have a point in arguing that\nthe US government’s decision created a precedent that could and most probably\nwill nurture in the future a moral hazard, i.e 
 The risk that the management of\nthe Financial Institutions will be impervious to the detrimental effects of actions\non the Economy and the People, as long as these actions are serving the\nmanagement’s selfish interests 
 Those who blindly believe in the “Invisible Hand” that\nsupposedly makes egoistic self-interest a powerful force of progress should\nhave been awaken following the mortgage crisis of 2007 
 It should be obvious to everyone concerned\nthat if a Class of Financial Institutions is so vital to the Economy that they\ndeserve to be rescued by Public Money whenever they tumble then it follows that\nthe management of these institutions is in effect managing Public Money and\ntherefore they should be treated analogously 
 In Ancient Athens acts of corruption that resulted to loss\nof Public money were punished with the death penalty 
 I am not advocating so draconian measures 
 Nonetheless, Financial Institutions that are\ncritical to the functioning of the Economy and are too important to be let\nfail, should be regulated accordingly and their management should be held\nresponsible for financial catastrophes that lead to loss of Public Money and should\nbe punished accordingly

6803,981,344,4,2017-06-24 12:44:15,"That question brings the paramount of today's financial politics into reflexion, and I am happy to offer a tentative answer to it 
 First of all, the U.S 
 Government did not simply ""waste"" public's money with the bailouts 
 TARP program ended in a net profit for the U.S 
 Government, regrouping $441 billions out of $426 invested in a 6-years timespan 
 So the public's purse did not waste a single cent with this action, inflation accounted for. Secondly, this bailout was organised for systematically important banks only, and without so, the economy as a whole would have been put in great danger 
 Bailouts were not organised for poorly managed banks, but only those deemed at risk for the economy as a whole 
 These two points are very important to recall, because they just speak for themselves 
 It was a cost-efficient solution to respond to a highly risky situation 
 Believing that the ethical implications can outweigh the excellent solution, technically speaking, that the U.S 
 Government brought at that very time, does not seem reasonable to me 
 If it had to be done again, it surely should be the case 
 Now, picking up this side of the debate does not mean that the ethical implications should be completely offset 
 It is critical in my opinion to combine this view with a stricter approach on two dimensions 
 First, the U.S 
 Government should make sure to use the profits from TARP, minus inflation, to provide extra resources to forensic and investigative departments analysing the historical wrongdoers (in additional to their regular budget, as a sort of ""bonus"" cashflow) 
  Secondly, the implication of some key executive individuals at the systematically important institutions, is so sensitive to the wider economy and the society at large, that they should be subject to the same level of personal responsibility that judiciary, military or governmental personnel may have 
 That includes, to speak bluntly, criminal responsibility in some cases 
 As such, I strongly believe that the best answer to the current debate around public bailouts is to keep being supportive of them, to avoid at any cost a bigger crisis, while at the same time strengthening both investigative and retaliatory options against wrongdoers 
 Attempting to bear the cost on other (innocent) investors, or the public at large, does not seem to be the most ethical solution a society could wish for"

 I don't feel that just because a company that reports negative earnings should be sold or ignored 
 One quarter doesn't spell doom for a company or the stock 
 Which is why it can be foolish to pick a stock based on simple valuation methodologies because they only give a snap shot into the true value of a company

 It could be overpriced, an earlier example in the course was given how Nokia was the most bought company during the dot com rush and in-turn became highly over valued, i believe using Nokia's market price to find a fair value of another technology company would have not given a exact fair price 
 Companies that have reported a loss have a negative Net Price Value, therefore it is not advisable to invest in them 
 However companies that are comparable might still have distinctive characteristic 
 If a distinctive characteristic might be conclusively responsible for recorder loss in the comparable firm (firm A), and the company we are interested in (firm B) has an advantage we might consider purchase 
 For example, market share is an important contributor to the earnings and in turn market value of a company 
 If firm B has recently taken over some of firm A's market share, a loss in firm A a must not deter interested parties to purchase firm B"

 .I don't mean to ""correct"" you, or imply you're wrong, but I personally disagree with your first paragraph's concept 
 In my opinion, in the case of an investor with high risk tolerance who's willing to go for high returns, hedging in such high (again, in my opinion) percentages through gold seems it would have a very negative impact on his portfolio's overall returns, especially in the long term 
 My reasoning behind this is that, during ""normal"" or stable economic conditions, the opportunity cost of holding gold rises even more, not to mention the fact that it's quite a volatile investment by itself too (you might quite easily see its price drop, thus resulting in negative returns) 
  The only way one could really benefit would be if a black swan event actually does happen

 It also requires a skills set to be able to group companies into the most likely suitable for comparison 
 One should reconsider using P/E ratios in the times of high asset prices (e.g 
 2000 dot com bust, 2007-2008 Great Financial Crisis) 
  P/E ratio in essence tells how much money investors are willing and able to pay for $1 in earnings of the company 
 In theory markets are efficient, in practice, they are inefficient 
 Frequently, the P/E ratio would be far distant from the actual earnings of the company and it would solely rely on investor sentiment and anticipated progression of the company 
 But the results of the company depend on external and internal factors, strong management belonging to the latter group 
 Hence, should management fail to deliver or external factors (e.g 
 Government regulations, natural disasters, changes in consumer preferences, intense competition) have negative impact the high P/E multiple paid would be worth less and would fail to leave up to the expectations 
 In case of companies reporting negative earnings, I would suggest looking at trailing 12 months results and in particular diving into the factors that resulted in negative earnings 
 Perhaps it could have been a one time accounting treatment (write-down, asset impairment, investment write down, etc.) 
  Therefore, it is more important to look at the the historic performance and equally dive into the financials to understand the root cause of the loss 
 However, if it proves that the loss is related to changes in market structure, consumer preference, etc., then one may become cautious about using of multiples cause there is a clear indication that the company's future performance will gradually deteriorate unless circuit breakers are in place and management is considering alternatives to take back market share and improve profitability"

 But most importantly i think the credit rating firms should be investigated more, since they were the ones who packaged the laons to a BBB  rating or some times higher when it was not. If there would have been more control the banks would not have been able to sell its bad loans 
 Maybe the government should put a certan roof of amounts that a person/company can lend 
 Like for example in Sweden, you can only borrow an amount of maximum 85% of the house you are plannign to buy, but with a maximum of 5-6.5 times the yearly household income 
 I think the multiple should be lower but it is something atleast 
 You are also required by law to pay the mortage every month if you borrow more than 70%"

6923,1944,664,4,2018-07-18 18:41:16,"I may have this wrong, but I think that the block chain issue has a few similarities and a few differences 
 The  _domain_  and the subprime bubbles existed, in part, because of the overvaluation by betting on a value that wasn't supported by the underlying investment 
 This is true of block chain, but I think it is true for a different reason, at least a different reason that the subprime bubble 
 The subprime bubble existed because of the overvaluation of security backed mortgages 
 There were real properties attached to the mortgages; however, the money loaned exceeded the value of the property 
 The block chain phenomena, like all currency, requires security and scarcity and an agreed about exchange value 
 The difference is that scarcity cannot be guaranteed because apparently lots of people are starting block chains 
 At last count, I think there were more than 100.  Additionally, the currency can't be considered ""secure"" because there have been several hacks 
 So, and this is a really rudimentary explanation, there are some similarities and some differences 
 I suppose that at the end of the class sequence I may have a more sophisticated answer"
6924,2909,2,4,2016-10-22 03:54:42,"The biggest assumption would be that the companies being compared are in the same stage of the business cycle 
 If a company A assumed to be in the growth stage just reported a loss and company B in the growth stage just reported positive earnings, there is still no significant indicator as to which company will appreciate more in the long run. Using multiples based valuation method requires knowing more qualitative characteristics about each company and its history to gain an accurate picture"
6925,921,9,4,2016-03-31 07:15:06,"I think that the ""TARP"" was necessary otherwise there would have been a prolonged recession

6927,771,35,4,2016-10-30 21:13:20,"The multiples method relies on the law of one price, i.e 
 Similar assets should sell at a similar price 
 The assumption here is that there should be such a similar asset 
 In particular companies with various revenues sources may have different revenue drivers, and no equivalent peers 
 In addition, the method is based on accounting data 
 This means that the analysis is solely based on historical data, which (on their own) can be bad predictors of future revenues and profits 
 In particular, when earnings are negative, the resulting ratios are more difficult to interpret 
 Also, if the accountant has been ""creative"", meaning that some less positive financial data have been skilfully hidden, the multiple method will give an overly positive result 
 Finally, specfically the P/E ratio uses the company's share price as well, which embodies also investors' expectations regarding future profitability 
 However, in times of ""bubbles"", e.g 
 The Internet bubble of the early 2000s, these expectations can be too high, in which case it is not wise to use the P/E ratio"

  We did see some bank failures though it was not transparent as to which qualified for government support and which did not, though the subsequent too big to fail criteria helped us gain better understanding 
 This has come at a cost with increasing capital requirements 
 In the meduim to longer term, incentives of bank CEO's and staff need to be better aligned with longer term performance and not just annual performance 
 Banks should not be rewarded with taking bigger risk positions to bolster short term earning potential to then be bailed out should the outsized risk actually materialize  
  Differentiating between the investment banking and personal banking should remove the need for the government to feel the need to blanket bail out the entire industry 
 TARP was an unconventional approach to a unique problem, how about next time , will the govement be able to perform the same again trick again , what systems can be put in place to limit the aggregate risk and catorgies of those who are eligible (if any) for future bailouts 
 Have the seeds been planted with inflated stock and hosing prices since the commencement of QE and simlair tools around the world."

6937,135,12,4,2017-10-23 02:27:35,"The underlying assumption used when using any formula ratio is that the company is protected from any outside threats and/or instability in the market 
 These ratios assume that things such as yearly revenue growth remains the same, sudden market changes such as seen in 2008 and 2001 don't occur (or rather, don't effect that firm) and so forth 
 These formulas are based purely in the assumption that the firm continues on the same path without any disturbances 
 Had I had the knowledge I have today, I would not be comfortable using ratios during any era pre-2010 
 Due to the lack of technology during those days and the tendency of many firms (as expected) to use faulty numbers in their reporting standards - one might believe that a certain industry is booming and thus invest in a firm that in reality is generating zero profits (or rather, not profits that would originally satisfy the investor) 
  Give, for instance, if investors saw that Enron, having been booming during its era, was moving up in terms of market capitalization - the assumption would be that the entire industry was booming as-well 
 Using multiple based evaluation they might believe similar firms would boom as-well 
 If an investor sees that a firm has reported a negative loss - that investor should take time to identify where that loss came from and determine if it was a part of regular operations (decline in demand, decline in revenue, cost increase) or an unusual circumstance (natural disaster) by reviewing the company's financials 
 If the loss is a part of ordinary operations, the investor should determine then if he believes that the upcoming years will include a return to regular growth or if this instance of loss is foreshadowing a downfall of the firm 
 From thereon the investor should be capable of determining his new position on the firm"

6944,2708,349,4,2016-05-17 10:23:51,"In ""normal"" times probably around 10% would be appropriate, but presently it could be argued that with the excessive quantitative easing of Central Banks, and the consequential debasing the value of paper money, one should hold a greater percentage of gold, given the possible growing lack of faith in paper money, and the likelihood of excessive inflation, (eventually!) We are taught in this course the prevailing economic theory that increasing the money supply causes inflation., and therefore the need to hold gold 
 My question is, why is it not happening this time, despite the greatest money printing in history 
 Could it be that the problem is on the demand side, in that corporations and households the world over are maxed out on debt, and so it doesn't matter how low the interest rates are, borrowing and growth are not happening this time 
 Any ideas"
6945,3690,3,4,2017-03-08 12:07:28,"When we use these multiples for our analysis, we suppose that comparable firms are similar in terms of industry, operating risk and stage of development 
 In addition, using the P/E ratio, we assume that the comparable firms have also a similar financing structure (e.g 
 Financial leverage) 
  I strongly believe that the Achilles' heel of this method is finding the right firm 
 In my opinion, it is very difficult to identify a firm which has the same features (industry, operating risk and stage development) of the firm in consideration 
 In addition, comparable companies must have prices that correctly reflect their value 
 We have already seen that this statement is not always true 
 For instance, in case of a overvalued firm the price would be bigger and it wouldn't represent the real value of the firm 
 Taking a price of an overvalued company, it will make a mistake in our evaluation"

 In certain cases different multiples may also apply for companies in different countries 
 For negative earnings, we could use multiples such as Price / Sales 
 Further analysis needs to go into why negative earnings exists (long term issue, temporary issue, cyclical), and further valuation adjustments should be done to accurately value the equity"

6955,1145,280,4,2016-09-17 15:29:01,"First of all by looking at market observed ratios, we assume that the market has priced the share of a company correctly - Ie 
 All historical and current information is priced into it, which also leads us to assume some form of efficient market 
 The investor also has to make sure that he/she chooses actual comparable companies when looking at ratios 
 A great example of a period where using multiples was a bad idea was during the dot-com bubble where startups received crazy valuations based on completely unknown profitability of the concept/product 
 Even in todays world its difficult to use multiples in certain sectors, because of the new types of companies that innovation has allowed to blossom 
 If a company reports a loss, P/E ratios doesnt make sense and other valuation methods must be considered, such as DCF or looking at relative value (Ie 
 Comparable companies) and EV/EBITDA for these"

 Alexander, the correct answer for profit is DEFINITELY NOT 7, but I would guess that Victor mentioned it so that he does NOT give the correct answer according to The Coursera Honor Code 
 I would strongly recommend that you look at his discussion with Wenzhe before mentioning the number 7 or the negative value because those are misleading

 He says that cooling and too cold are the worst, because it is deflation 
 But on the chart where it shows real returns, cooling is actually second best to the perfection category, meaning this is the 2nd best scenario 
 So maybe does this mean that cooling is ok, as long as its not too far into that quadrant, like a little bit of 'low inflation' and a little bit of 'low gdp growth' but not so much as to cause a deflation or to get 'too cold'

 Yes, I noticed I couldn't find the explicit formula for discounted cash flows in the videos or notes 
 This is pretty key. You can google ""discounted cash flow"" for additional guidance but I'll go over it briefly 
 Also, the equations indeed can be a little overwhelming, but breaking each equation down and writing everything out can make them more manageable 
 So, for example 1: (NPV and DCF are basically the same)   hope that helps"

 As I understand it, the FX currency market works through exchange of one currency for another 
 For example Euros for Dollars 
 The largest share of exchanges are for US Dollars 
 Euros for USD, Yen for USD, etc. The four major currency pairs all have USD as part 
 That's why they sum up to more than 100% 
  Because each currency represents only half of a pair

7360,3778,494,0,2018-05-31 16:26:24,"There are two main assumptions we make about comparable companies PE ratios: we assume that the comparable companies are operating under stable (no financial distress) and fair (free-market trade and balanced government regulation to promote fair trade) financial market conditions 
 Two recent instances that I would not feel comfortable using PE ratios to valuate companies:   The great recession in 2007 
 Companies earning were close to 0 while stock prices were slow to react and relatively moderate, which caused the PE ratio to be heavily inflated by spiking upward 
 Internet bubble burst in 2001 
 Internet companies were overvalued with extreme stock prices while the companies earning were moderate, which caused the PE ratio to be inflated 
 For companies that reports a loss, I would do more due diligence to understand what caused the loss 
 The loss may be caused by a multitude of factors that are outside the company's control  
  For example:   Unplanned increase in corporate tax law   Unforeseen circumstances to supplier shortage   Unforeseen government regulation   Unforeseen natural disasters   However, there are cases where the market has extreme optimism on a company's potential despite a loss in earning 
 The best example would be Tesla, where the stock price is showing $290 (as of 5/30/2018) despite reporting a loss of $1.9B USD and -$11.83 EPS in 2017 
 I would be extremely wary on investing in companies like Tesla (especially with a current ratio of 0.86 and negative interest coverage in 2017) because I'm not sure how Tesla's financials will survive the next recession, although I do think the US government and Elon Musk's charisma will be able to bail Tesla out"
7361,3779,405,0,2017-04-25 21:02:47,"I believe that despite moral objections to the TARP policy (banks were essentially bailed out while consumers in the real economy had not been equally compensated for their losses), it was an essential policy in recovering the US economy, which was highly dependent on access to credit like most developed economies 
 After the 2008 crisis, house prices, wages and the general economy had recovered to pre-2008 highs and has in fact exceeded those highs in several industries 
 According to the Bailout Scorecard, the Treasury lent $623 billion in bailouts, the bulk of which was disbursed to financial institutions, the automotive industry, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have now been taken over by the Federal Government 
 In return, they received $708 billion through the principle amount being paid back, in addition to dividends, interest earnings and sales of other assets and equities 
 In order to prevent careless behaviour and to prevent perverse incentives for banks, new regulation would have to be put in place 
 It is my belief that Dodd Frank isn't particularly effective in this regard, because it doesn't re-incorporate the Glass Steagall Act into its regulations - a piece of legislation that creates a clear separation between commercial and investment banking 
 In my view, the Dodd Frank legislation has also distorted competition in the financial sector by imposing excessive legislation on smaller community banks and credit unions, drastically reducing their ability to compete with larger financial firms in the bulge bracket, who have the means to absorb increased regulation through compliance and legal departments 
 This has in effect led to the industry being dominated by oligopolies; the biggest financial services firms are bigger in terms of market capitalisation, than they were before the 2008 crisis 
 To summarise, I believe that while regulations are important to prevent reckless behaviour, legislators must also take into account the effect they have on smaller competitors 
 Smart regulation is the key here, not more regulation"

7406,801,10,0,2018-06-14 19:09:07,"From a pure\neconomical perspective the U.S 
 Government had simply no choice than the bailout 
 We all know\nwhat happened with Lehman’s Brother and how this impacted private, public,\ninstitutional investors across the globe 
 Even the tiniest German Sparkasse had\ninvestments in Lehman’ Brother – all gone 
 Nobody had a clue what the impacts/consequences could be when other global financial institutions would default or wouldn’t\nbe able to ‘assist’ the global economic system 
 Below,\nthere are two shortened sub-chapters copied from my Diploma thesis (all footnotes were\nremoved to facilitate legibility) 
  I researched the impact of global financial\nflows on the real estate sector in transforming countries 
 The thesis was\nsubmitted in January 2012 at the Technical University Berlin 
 These\nsub-chapters emphasis how the global financial system and real estate sector is interrelated and\nembedded in the global political and economic landscape 
 Simply speaking,\nthe bailout was absolutely necessary to avoid a collapse of the entire system.\nIn this context, I tend to ignore any moral or business ethical discussion on\nthis question 
 The finance\nsector  The\nformation of the global financial system is the result of national deregulation\nof capital controls, liberalization of capital flows across the globe and the\nevolvement of new technologies, telecommunication and information based\neconomy 
 Since\nthe 1980s, the global economy has been experiencing a profound shift from an\nindustrial related one to a more financially integrated one. Between 1980 and\n1995, global capital flows have fluctuated between two and six percent of world\ngross domestic product (GDP) 
  This sharply grew to 14.8 percent of world GDP by\n2006 
 Moreover,\nannual global capital flows tripled between 1995 and 2006 to a total US$7.2\ntrillion 
 The rapid transformation of the financial sector to a key driver in\nglobalization can basically be traced back to three crucial changes during the\n1960s and 1970s 
 Firstly,\nthe emergence of a Eurocurrency market in the 1960s, in which the first\ninternational financial system was developed in which banks were dealing in\nforeign currency 
 The system supported cross-border transactions and avoided\ndomestic regulations for Transnational Corporations (TNCs) due the fact they\ndeposited their surplus funds in foreign currency, thus increasing the need for\nfinancial service activity 
 This has slowly softened under the Bretton Woods\nSystem (BWS), which was established to return security to national economic\nmarkets after years of high insecurity and low worldwide trade and investment\nduring the two World Wars 
 The\nBWS collapsed in 1973 when President Nixon questioned the pegging of the dollar\nto the gold reserves 
 Secondly, declining international confidence in the US\ndollar established a system where currency exchange rates were determined by\ntheir value on the global market 
 This established a foreign currency trading\nmarket, which is the largest financial market in the world 
 Currencies can be\nsimultaneously traded in a 24-hours market completely electronically.\nTherefore, thirdly, new technological innovations became a catalyst in the\nemergence of the huge electronic financial transactions that have contributed\nto the staggering evolution of the financial industry 
 The annual turnover in\nforeign exchange was US$17.5 trillion in 1979, increasing to a daily level of\nUS$3.5 trillion or US$1,277.5 trillion annually in 2007 
 One\nadditional aspect was crucial in the globalization process and rise of the\nfinancial sector 
 When the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)\nquadrupled the price of oil, most banks were faced by a dramatic surplus of\ncapital flows 
 Moreover, nations became more dependent on banking institutions\nwhen OPEC members decided to channel the majority of their earnings ―through\nthe transnational banks 
 Within four years, between 1976 and 1980, the major\ninternational banks experienced a staggering increase of 95 percent in their\naggregated assets 
 The capital accumulation of international banks also made\nthem increasingly become lending institutions to countries, which made these\ncountries increasingly dependent on these financial institutions - a key reason\nfor growing national financial deregulation 
 Facilitated\nby global improvements in communication infrastructure and deregulation of\ndomestic financial markets, securitization of debts into marketable instruments\ncontributed to competition and vast expansion of the financial market 
 Banks\nsecuritized formerly illiquid ‘assets‘, such as a mortgage loans into ‘new‘\nfinancial products, which could be traded on the stock market 
 TNCs increased\ncapitalization by issuing equities 
 Additionally, nation states participated in\nthe financial market by issuing bonds to increase liquidity for themselves.\nAnother ‘innovative‘ financial product concerns the emergence of a secondary\nmortgage market in the United States (U.S.) 
  Formerly illiquid debts became\ntransformed into liquid and tradable mortgage-backed securities that were\ntraded on the stock exchange 
 In particular with domestic financial\nliberalization in the early 1990s, individuals and institutional investors\nsignificantly contributed to an internationalization of financial market\nactivities by the purchase of equities, shares and bonds 
 The volume of\ninternational equity issued in 1986 was at US$32 billion 
 In 1999 it rose to\nthe staggering amount of US$28 trillion 
 Real estate\ndevelopment and globalization  The\ntransformation of the urban built environment reflects the global-local\ninterplay of globalisation forces 
 [ 
 ] 
  The real estate sector is also\nan investment form, which boosts through speculation the artificial production\nof the building stock in globalising cities 
 There\nare three main developments, which have contributed to the emergence of a\nglobal real estate market 
 First,\nthe global economy‘s shift towards banking and producer service activities\ndramatically increased the demand for offices 
 [ 
 ] 
  Since the 1980s, that has led to the construction of\nmillions of sq m of new office space 
 ―The rapid building of one high-rise office\ncomplex after another has transformed cities all across the world 
 Secondly,\nthere was an internationalisation of the office market by its developers, users\nand owners 
 [

  Increasing prices and growing demand for\noffice development produced record profits and attracted domestic and foreign\ninvestors 
 Panreiter emphasises that major cities, in particular those that\nhave dynamic developments in advanced producer services, also correspond high\non cross-border real estate investment 
 Part of these increasing cross-border\nreal estate transactions are based on the fact that the financial sector are\nusers and buyers of the commercial properties 
 [ 
 ] 
   Understanding\nthat real estate development is a very capital-intensive economic sector, real\nestate construction provided an ideal investment asset for the financial\nindustry 
 Real estate can act as securities and collateral for bank lending 
 In\nfact, this shows that office markets in globalising cities are linked in an\ninternational real estate and capital market 
 [ 
 ] 
   Thirdly,\nnew types of institutional investment by the end of the 1970s in form of\npension funds and insurance companies increased global real estate activities.\nConsiderable growth rates in the service sector, which promised constantly\nincreasing profits and the search for new long-term investment opportunities,\nwere major driving forces of institutional expansion 
 [ 
 ] 
  A\nkey aspect for the emergence of a global real estate market is the financial\nliberalisation [ 
 ] 
  In\nparticular, the securitisation of former fixed real estate assets into stocks\nand securities through real estate investment trusts (REITs) increased\nliquidity, transparency and capital volume for national and international\nproperty development 
 [ 
 ] 
  Predominantly\nthe securitisation of real estate from a fixed asset into a liquid and tradable\ncommodity enhanced global real estate market activities 
 A study by Jones Lang\nLaSalle in 2008 showed that the volume in direct commercial property investment\nhas more than doubled from US$354 billion in 2003 to US$759 billion in 2007.\nCross-border transactions have been also constantly growing 
 In 2003, worldwide\ncross-border commercial property transaction accounted for US$90 billion 
 That\nvolume grew to a staggering amount of US$353 billion in 2007 
 The promising\nyears of economic development between 2000 and 2007 also provided Asia-Pacific\nwith impressive economic growth rates 
 Cross-border transactions on commercial\nproperty accounted for 32 percent in 2006, and rapidly grew one year later to a\nremarkable 47 percent of all commercial property transactions in the region 
 [ 
 ] 
  Other\nfactors also increased real estate activities and their globalization 
 The\nglobal expansion of TNCs increased not just the demand for commercial real\nestate, but also the demand for residential property development, driven by a\ngrowing mobile expatriate population worldwide 
 The number of worldwide\nmigrants almost doubled from 136 million in 1990 to 210 million in 2010 
 Stimulating\nurban growth through housing and office construction has also successfully\nimpacted countries economic development by understanding how other supporting\nservices such as financing; architecture, consultancy, management and material\nproduction are involved in real estate production

 It seems that the measure has worked, for which I am glad 
 However, CBs should prevent the misbehaviour and careless strategies of banks and financial institutions, by stepping in and impose harder regulations in terms of lending policies 
 Yes, CB stepped in and saved the day, but it should come at a price for those institutions that were bailed out,  otherwise lessons will not be learnt 
 Financial institutions are so focused and eager to make a juicy profit, that usually forget the implications of their financial strategies in the long run.  My proposal:  1) Bailed out institutions should invest X% of their profits from 2010 onward on a housing program nation-wide, providing decent homes to those affected by the crash, at a low cost 
 2) Government should develop a financial coaching program (including TV ads) targeting mainly low and middle-class, to educate borrowers on the perks and cons of getting loans, resolving primarily one simple and usually overlooked question: ""do you really needed, or it is just a whim?"""

7439,449,106,0,2018-10-05 13:38:46,"Hi all, Perhaps I can help with some extra information: When calculating the value of a company (i.e 
 What a fair price would be for it), there are different methods to estimate the value of that company 
 There are two primary methods presented in this course so far: DCF and Multiples 
 First method, multiples: now, as you may know, multiples are based on the idea that you can compare two companies and base a valuation of off that 
 But we're talking primarily about DCF and Terminal Value 
 The idea behind valueing the company using a DCF is that you take the company's future Fcf's (which are then discounted for the time value of money: inflation) 
  Generally, you will do a DCF by taking 4 to 7 years of future cash flows 
 Remember that enterprise value is calculated as follows (also see lectures and slides): V0 = ( FCF1 / ( 1 + Rwacc )) + ( FCF2  / (( 1 + Rwacc ) ^2 ) +  ( FCFn  + Vn / (( 1 + Rwacc ) ^ n )  What does this mean 
 It means that we calculate firm value by taking all free cash flows, discount them over the years, and then sum then 
 However, we only do the free cash flows for a couple of years (e.g 
 4-7 years), that is why we take the terminal value for the remaining years (assuming the company keeps on functioning, continuing) 
   Let us assume that Company A has the following FcF: 2015: 1 million FCF And we believe that this will keep growing by 5% each year 
 Then the result for a simple analysis would be (rounded _smiley_  2016: 1.05 mil 2017:  1.1 mil 2018:  1.16 mil 2019:  1.22 mil However, we also need to discount these cash flows 
 Let us assume the discount rate is 9% 
  That would mean the relevant FcFs would be: (The FcF / ( Discount rate ^ years ) ) 2016:  0.96 mil  (1.05 million / ( 1.09 ^ 1 ) ) 2017:  0.93 mil ( 1.1 million / ( 1.09 ^ 2) 2018:  0.90 mil ( 1.16 million / ( 1.09 ^ 3) 2019: 0.86 mil ( 1.22 million / ( 1.09 ^ 4) That is a total of: 3.65 million 
 Note:    But, we also need to calculate the terminal value 
 The formula for the terminal value is as follows:  Vn = ( ( 1 + Gfcf ) / ( Rwacc - Gfcf ) ) x FcFn This means that for your terminal value you divide your growth factor (5% in my case, so 1.05) by your discount rate minus your growth factor (so in my case 9 %- 5% = 0.04) 
  In our case this is:   1.05/0.04 = 26.25 
 And then you apply that number times the cash flow of the last year 
 That means, 0.86 million x 26.25 = 22.6 million  Total value:  3.65 mil + 22.6 mil = 26.25 mil  Note: I hope I made no mistakes 
 It may be wise to figure out what discount rates are, free cash flows, etc. I hope this helped, let me know if you have questions"

7443,3796,1170,0,2017-07-21 02:49:17,"Considering this example, I understand that the investor gets his capital back some time before the bond's maturity 
 Furthermore, since the cash flows are equal on the left and on the right of the equilibrium, then having received his capital by year 4 let's say, he will have to receive on year 5 his capital+ a coupon 
 This means that in 5 years he will have a sum of capital(coupons until equilibrium)+capital(year 5 return)+a coupon(year 5 coupon) = 2 capital + a coupon 
 So he will more than double his investments

  The consequences are in a timely order: 1) increased income inequality leading to 2)  global anger and discontent of large populations leading to 3) unusual political decisions aimed to ""correct"" the system leading to 4) political and social instability leading to 5) war.

7489,29,233,0,2017-02-01 20:41:46,"Hi Mahmoud, Thank you for you interest and enjoyment of the course 
 You bring up a good question about leverage and borrowing costs 
 In regards to the interest rate on amounts you borrow, the example given by the instructor assumes no borrowing costs, however in the real world you do pay interest on capital 
 So, you are right that your returns would be decreased depending on the interest paid 
 These costs could be substantial, but as a proportion of total capital invested, might be a few percentage points or less 
 2 
 In regards to leverage in the example: even though you pay back the $100 you borrowed, you still have made $20 profit on your initial $100 investment which is 20% 
  Compared to not having leverage you would have made $10 on $100, which is 10% 
  Furthermore, in some financial markets and (more so for hedge funds), you can get leverage that is more than 2:1 
 For example you might get 20:1 or 100:1 
 This is where leverage takes on greater risk and reward 
 With 20:1 leverage your $100 now controls $2000 and making 10% of $2000 = $200 or $200 profit 
 In this example, you made $200 profit on a $100 investment with leverage and would have only made $10 without 
 As the instructor mentions, leverage can also amplify your losses 
 Hence, leverage-related financial crises"

7493,707,1174,0,2016-02-25 03:39:21,"You need  knowledge (education) and experience to know which information is important to enable you to develop an opinion on what constitutes over-valued and under-valued 
 Annual reports and the Financial Times are old news that others have already acted upon 
 There isn't a lone number in an annual report or column in the FT or WSJ  that can tell you if a stock is over-valued or under-valued 
 You also need a lot of capital to be able to spread your risks among many different securities 
 The instructor uses somewhat extreme examples in which a stock goes from $100 to $50 
 That won't happen often 
 There are many things taught in this course that a small investor won't have the resources, time, or ability to act on 
 But, that doesn't mean that you can't be a successful investor 
 Most mutual fund managers beat the S&P 500 after their costs 
 You can closely match the return of the S&P500 (or other indexes) very cheaply

7494,272,1175,0,2016-06-16 01:16:30,"Hi Chang, Thanks for posting this question 
 First video and Second video illustrate two different scenarios 
 In the first video, the lecturer is talking about the yearly return of a stock or any other asset 
 As you can clearly see, you cannot add those percentages as it is simply because at the end of year 1 you have lost half of your initial investment (as per the example) 
  So if you add two percentages you will not see the overall picture 
 However, in the second video, the lecturer is calculating the average return 
 It's a comparison between the performance of two stocks 
 In that scenario, the monthly returns were calculated considering the last month's price (e.g 
 At the beginning of the July, let's say the price of Stock A is 100. At the end of July it is 101. At the end of August, the price is 101*1.01) 
  Therefore in this scenario, you can add the percentages and calculate the average return 
 Hope this clarifies 
 Cheers \n"

  You already found your NPV benefit using the DCF and in this case the NPV is just the difference between the two stock prices

7527,449,353,0,2016-02-26 16:43:29,"Hi all, Perhaps I can help with some extra information: When calculating the value of a company (i.e 
 What a fair price would be for it), there are different methods to estimate the value of that company 
 There are two primary methods presented in this course so far: DCF and Multiples 
 First method, multiples: now, as you may know, multiples are based on the idea that you can compare two companies and base a valuation of off that 
 But we're talking primarily about DCF and Terminal Value 
 The idea behind valueing the company using a DCF is that you take the company's future Fcf's (which are then discounted for the time value of money: inflation) 
  Generally, you will do a DCF by taking 4 to 7 years of future cash flows 
 Remember that enterprise value is calculated as follows (also see lectures and slides): V0 = ( FCF1 / ( 1 + Rwacc )) + ( FCF2  / (( 1 + Rwacc ) ^2 ) +  ( FCFn  + Vn / (( 1 + Rwacc ) ^ n )  What does this mean 
 It means that we calculate firm value by taking all free cash flows, discount them over the years, and then sum then 
 However, we only do the free cash flows for a couple of years (e.g 
 4-7 years), that is why we take the terminal value for the remaining years (assuming the company keeps on functioning, continuing) 
   Let us assume that Company A has the following FcF: 2015: 1 million FCF And we believe that this will keep growing by 5% each year 
 Then the result for a simple analysis would be (rounded _smiley_  2016: 1.05 mil 2017:  1.1 mil 2018:  1.16 mil 2019:  1.22 mil However, we also need to discount these cash flows 
 Let us assume the discount rate is 9% 
  That would mean the relevant FcFs would be: (The FcF / ( Discount rate ^ years ) ) 2016:  0.96 mil  (1.05 million / ( 1.09 ^ 1 ) ) 2017:  0.93 mil ( 1.1 million / ( 1.09 ^ 2) 2018:  0.90 mil ( 1.16 million / ( 1.09 ^ 3) 2019: 0.86 mil ( 1.22 million / ( 1.09 ^ 4) That is a total of: 3.65 million 
 Note:    But, we also need to calculate the terminal value 
 The formula for the terminal value is as follows:  Vn = ( ( 1 + Gfcf ) / ( Rwacc - Gfcf ) ) x FcFn This means that for your terminal value you divide your growth factor (5% in my case, so 1.05) by your discount rate minus your growth factor (so in my case 9 %- 5% = 0.04) 
  In our case this is:   1.05/0.04 = 26.25 
 And then you apply that number times the cash flow of the last year 
 That means, 0.86 million x 26.25 = 22.6 million  Total value:  3.65 mil + 22.6 mil = 26.25 mil  Note: I hope I made no mistakes 
 It may be wise to figure out what discount rates are, free cash flows, etc. I hope this helped, let me know if you have questions"
7528,386,1181,0,2016-09-22 04:31:35,"The purpose of duration: The most important metric to mesure the price sensitivity  of a bond due to interest rates variation over the years 
 What are we measruing: The equilibrium point in time, of the  NPVs of all the cash flows 
 It means that the sum of present value of the cash flows prior to the duration point is equal the sum of present values of cash flows after the duration point 
 That part is merely technical 
 Why is it important 
 Once you buy a bond, it can be translated to a cash flow scheme, therefore you can measure the value of that bond 
 You measure that value using a given interest rate 
 (which will be the same during all the years until the maturity) 
  So, it's important to know that the value of your bond will never change 
 The amount of money that you will recieve in each coupon and the principal will never change 
 But what about it's value in the market, in other words, what about it's price 
 Let's assume that yesteray you bought a government bond with the following conditions:   Price: $1000    Interest rate: 10%   Maturity: 10 years 
 Coupons issued at the end of each year 
 Then, today the government raised the interest rate from 10% to 20% 
  Obiviously, the same $1000 is going to be much more proftable now, right 
 And also today, you need some money and decided to sell the bond you bought yesterday 
 Nobody is going to buy it for $1000, they prefer buy direct from the government 
 So, for how much are you going to sell 
 You can make that calculation very easily using the duration metric, like we saw on the video"

7557,43,1184,0,2016-02-10 16:01:47,"Hi Ravi, In the formula, ""r"" is the (current) yield to maturity of your bond 
 When we say that ""r"" increases from 10% to 12%, we mean that there are now bonds in circulation (from the same issuer as yours, the same time to maturity and face value) with a yield to maturity of 12% instead of 10% (i.e 
 With a higher coupon rate than yours) 
   The formula we see in this video and which uses duration gives you an approximation of the drop in the price of your bond now that these new bonds came into existence 
 Indeed and as we have seen in the previous video, the price of your bond must drop to remain attractive in comparison with the new bonds now available to investors 
 I hope this clears things up 
 Best regards, Jonas"

7655,1606,22,0,2016-02-28 11:19:35,"Let me answer to this question with an example 
 Let's say you are a Greek citizen in 2016 
 You have a portfolio of investments which includes Greek gov bonds, Greek stocks and Euros in cash (Euro is the nominal currency of Greece) 
  Should you have gold in your portfolio 
 The answer is a big YES because all the reasons to have gold hold in Greece today at the same time 
 (1) The stock market has crashed (the index has collapsed due to the recapitalization of the banks 
 (2) The bonds have significantly high credit risk despite the controlled ""delaultability"" 
  Bonds are not safer than stocks and the risk premiums are really high 
 (3) Holding real estate has not negative correlation to the rest of the economy 
 The prices of the assets have fallen due to the tax policy on real estate assets, and stagnated 
 (4) Holding cash is less risky, but also risky 
 It brings no returns to euro holders 
 The risk-free rate (the interbank policy rate like the fed-fund) is near to minus, and the quantitative easing expanded by the ECB (in relation to the return to normality by the FED, makes the euro weaker 
 (5) There is also very low opportunity cost 
 In a stagnated market which was highly leveraged in the previews period of the business cycle, the process of de-leveraging is very slow 
 This means that the investment opportunities ahaid in time (at least in the mid-term) have disappeared 
 This reduces the opportunity cost of holding gold in the mid-term 
 (6) Last but not least, the political uncertainty in the Greek Government, the unstable relationship with the EU and the extra costs that the immigration crisis impose to the Greek budget, increases the political tension, the uncertainty over the prospect of political stability as well as the negative expectations of the future deficits of Greece, which rises the possibility for further tax burdens 
 (7) Having the previous six paragraphs in my mind, I wonder if there are also white swans, because all the swans I have seen so far are.

7687,272,1196,0,2016-06-21 16:33:01,"Hi Scott, Thanks for asking this important question 
 \nWhen the stock market goes up one day, and \nthen goes down for the next five, then up again, and then down again, \nthat’s what you call stock market volatility 
 \n\n\nVolatility is measured by the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE), \nprimarily through the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) and, to a lesser \nextent, the CBOE Nasdaq Volatility Index (VXN) for technology stocks 
 \nThe VIX tracks the speed of stocks’ price movements in the S&P 100; \nthe VXN tracks it in Nasdaq 100 stocks 
 Both indices take a weighted \naverage of the estimated volatility of eight stocks on a particular \nindex 
 Both are calculated every 60 seconds over the CBOE’s trading day,\n which means it records a great deal of fluctuation 
 \n\n\n\nSeasoned traders who monitor the markets closely usually buy stocks and \nindex options when the VIX is high 
 When the VIX is low, it usually \nindicates that investors believe the market will head higher 
 This, in \nturn, can trigger a market selloff, as speculators try to unload their \nholdings at premium prices.\n\n\n\nBearish types argue, however, that any value to the VIX’s past behavior \nended on September 11 
 They say the market is up against too many \nthings, including the economy, wary investors, and ongoing fear of \nterrorist attacks 
 Others blame volatility on 24/7 financial news on \ncable and the Internet, since people can watch the market move in front \nof their eyes.\n\n Hope this helps 
 Thanks, Chaturaka\n\n\n \n\n\n"

7707,1380,1198,0,2017-07-21 03:06:23,"In the lecture, he describes two scenarios for a 1000 dollar portfolio 
 One where you own 100 of a stock and the other where you short 100.  I understand the basic point: when you lose on a long bet, you own less of the stock, when you lose on a short bet you own more 
 This seems obvious by the very nature of the bets 
 However, what I am having trouble with is how he determines what portion of your portfolio the short bet actually is 
 What I am wondering is the net value of a short is zero initially:  you borrow 100 for a stock (-100), and immediately sell it (+100) and place the money with the bank as collateral so net impact to your investments is zero 
 This assumes you are one of the lucky few that the bank would actally do this for!  So for a portfolio of 1000 dollars, he seemed to be calculating that this net zero made up 10% 
   And he only put out 900 to make up the portfolio 
 In the other case, he had to invest 1000 
 So the example seems like comparing apples to oranges in some sense 
 When I initially answered the question, I stated that the relative position in the first portfolio decreased by assuming that we made 8.88% on the 900 (+80)  portion, and lost 80% on the 100 (-80) for a end value of 980+20 = 1000 with the 10% decreasing to 2% 
   For the second one it is not so straight forward if you think about it 
 We invested 1000 in the first portfolio (I assume real cash) in the second we only put 900 real cash, and have a 100 loan for the short 
 If the short increases by 20% and our 900 investment increases by 2.22% (20 dollars) then we can take the 20 dollars and pay for the margin call and still have net value of 1000 (although total value of 1020) 
   In this case, one could consider that the net outlay for the short is still 100 and for the other part is 900 - so the relative portions do not change 
 Or you could consider the total value of 1020 and compare to 120 which gives an 11.7% increase 
 I'm sure he did not mean for us to think this hard about it - but a ""real world"" apples to apples comparison would have been more useful in my opinion 
 And this leaves me with the question - how do you compute the actual value of a short in your portfolio"

 Granted, their point was that one needed to look at the whole picture instead of just the last return, but comparing the arithmetic averages of the return seems misleading to me (especially after the earlier videos on common mistakes people make) 
  It seems to me that the average return should be computed as follows:  Stock A: ( (1 + 1%) * (1 + 1%) * (1 + 13%))^(1/3) - 1 = 4.85% Stock B: ((1 + 13%) * (1+3%) * (1 + 2%))^(1/3) - 1 = 5.89%"

 Using definition of ""comparable firms"" 
  We suppose that the comparable firms have the same operating risk (from the same industry) and similar stage of development (expected growth rate) will have relevant (to multiples) price in the stock market 
 For P/E multiples we also suppose that the comparable firms have a similar financial structure (financial leverage) 
   Were there instances in history where you would not have felt comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods to value companies 
 I am a software engineer (from financial technology company, by the way) and I can refer to an example of the Instant Messenger programs (Skype, Viber, Telegram, WhatsApp) 
  It is the same industry (IT) and the same sub-industry (end-user, IM), and there is just a little different stage of development 
 We have to exclude Skype (according to multiples) because it is older, but other IMs start in approximately same time 
 It is serious limitation of multiples method, because it is the same area and skype user experience (positive and negative) is very important for other IMs, and sometimes IMs make some steps to harvest skype auditory to own side 
 But because skype is the old company (and now is part of Microsoft), we must exclude it from our observation 
 Let us continue 
 We also must exclude Telegram, because it is own project of Pavel Durov (without external or angel investments) and we can not evaluate this project in any way.  Ok, exclude Skype and Telegram, and what do we see? The most important metric for IM is the user's auditory, it's about 1B for WatsApp and about 750M for Viber 
 Viber was sold for about $900M, while WhatsApp - about $19B (to facebook) What is the key difference 
 Why does the price differ in 19 times while user's auditory differs just about 25% 
  So, we should consider other background, such as relationship between companies 
 Facebook was in need of any IM, because IM is the important source of user's information (which is used in internet advertising) 
   Facebook considers the leaders of the local areas, and WU was (and is) the most popular messenger in Latin America 
 Finally facebook has a growth of user's auditory in Latin America because another FB-killer Orkut (popular in Latin America) has been died and there was a great concurrency between social networks (VK, FB, OK, MS) 
  Buying the WhatsApp Facebook has automatically received the auditory of Latin America, but note please it's important only for Facebook and as long as you have workable model of earnings from auditory (FB has) 
  As a result Facebook wanted a lot to receive WhatsApp and was ready to pay extraordinary $19B. It is the reason of 20-times difference between WhatsApp and Viber, and we can NOT explain this phenomena using multiples method 
 What about companies that just reported a loss (i.e 
 Negative earnings) 
   I think it depends on concrete industry, country and condition 
 In the some industries (such as oil & gas) negative earnings in the oil bear market is OK (according to sector risks) In financial sector area in Russia in 2014-2016 is the same thing (according to country risks)"

  What would you say when S&P 500 is trading at 2,000 3 years later 
 Think about valuation like how you would think about buying a new pair of shoes - you are valuing it by thinking , how much utility (reward/enjoyment/comfort) you are deriving given the price you are paying 
 Would you say you are 'valuing' the shoes by just thinking of the price of the shoes and how many pairs of shoes you are buying 
 Probably not. I suggest, when thinking about valuation, it is always good to keep in mind that you are valuing a stock by how much utility it is giving to you (In terms of dividend yield, capital appreciation, etc) per unit price you are paying 
 Going back to the example in my first paragraph, and we make one more assumption: that the number of outstanding shares remain the same - what if I tell you now the initial earnings was 100 billion when the index was 2,500, but the earnings has risen to 200 billion when the index was 2,000"

  I manually did DCF. Don't forget that the denominator of anything after fcf1 needs to be squared, cubed, and so on 
 In the cells beside the FCF data I actually placed the formula for this (so fcf1 gets 1.11, fcf2 gets =1.11^2, fcf3 gets =1.11^3) 
  Don't round the result 
 I then manually solved the problem on excel with this formula: =(B12/C12)+(B13/C13)+((B14+B15)/C14) Cell contents are: B12=fcf1; c12=1.11; b13=fcf2;c13=1.11^2; b14=fcf3; b15=terminal value of 6000; c14=1.11^3 You should get a result of 5314.3349 Subtract debt of 1000 (btw, I kept missing this and couldn't figure out why I couldn't get the answer right) 
  Then divide the result by the number of shares 
 You should get 43.14 
 Round to 43 
 After that, answer to question 5 should be straightforward

7793,2724,30,0,2016-10-09 19:34:09,"The depression which resulted from the sub-prime crisis had a very sobering effect on banks 
 I do not wish to rely too heavily on that weakest of props, the stereotype, but most bankers are sober individuals who realize the vast responsibility over billions of dollars which they have 
 While I am not a ""classic"" economist, and am more than happy to explore the many events where too orthodox of an approach to economics has fallen down, I sense that in the lead up to the crisis of 2008 there was widespread economic amnesia 
 Many sectors of the public, and certainly more than bankers, were talking absolute rubbish ; they spoke up the arrival of a period of boom which would be like no other, and which would continue apace, holding in defiance notions of an inevitable bust 
 (Of the existence of similar types in London in 1720 or Amsterdam in the late 1630s they seemed remarkably ignorant.) I am a resident of the Irish Republic, location of a property-based ""bubble"", yet I and others were castigated as latter-day Cassandras when we advised restraint 
 But to return to the question, I think that central bankers and bankers in general, were genuinely shocked at the extent of the decline which occurred 
 They do not see future government intervention as something which they can rely on in future 
 Such intervention is equivalent to a massive vote of ""no confidence"" in the banking community, and bankers (like others) have their pride

 And that it hedges against market crashes, political strife, inflationary environments, and loose monetary policy 
 It's return since 1971 has been 8.5% 
   So how much to allocate to gold 
 I would argue only as much as you need 1) for insurance to get by in doomsday scenario, and 2) for bragging rights 
 [Disclaimer 
 Quick and dirty math ahead via eyeballing charts]  While gold returned 8.5% since 1971, much of that was in the 70's as the USD was decoupled from the gold standard, and then again the 10-yr period beginning 2001 with 9/11 and the Middle East 
 If I invested when I was born in 1980 after gold came off it's peak, I would have had a 0% or negative return adjusted for inflation even until today; compare that to the S&P, where I would have a substantial return ~900% 
   If I invested when gold bottomed in 2001, however, gold would outperform the S&P by 3:1 
 Looking at the chart for gold, we see it moves through long trends of positive or negative returns, and much of how gold performs as an investment depends on your starting reference point in one of these trends 
 If you bought into gold just 2-3 years after the bottom in 2001, you would have missed a substantial part of it's returns over the run-up 
 So what is gold's long-term performance 
 After all, CAPM uses long term returns and risks 
 Going back 200 years and adjusting for inflation:  $1 in USD would give you ~$0.06 today, $1 in Gold would give you $1.95, and Stocks would give you $755,163. (Forbes May 26, 2013) 
   Looking at these long-term rates and risks, gold has had lower returns and higher risks; its average returns are just above that of inflation 
 In terms of an investment on its own, it did poorly, but certainly acted as a store of value far exceeding cash 
 However, any CAPM tangent portfolio created that includes gold and is created from this data, could achieve higher returns and lower risk by excluding gold completely 
 (The same was true of holding currency.)  Based solely on this, it's proper allocation in your portfolio would be 0% 
  So where is the merit 
 As emphasized, as insurance against black swans, and accepting a the opportunity cost of lower returns 
 In terms of insurance, you aren't looking at the upside gains and getting rich off of insurance 
 It is there as a means to protect against the downside 
 How much insurance do you pay?

 5 years, but I did not find any source where it would be clearly stated that the interval must always be 1 year for this kind of calculation

7856,244,1220,0,2017-07-21 05:41:58,"Dear Mr 
 Girardin, In your lecture on hedge funds, you presented an example and a quiz related to the weights of long and short positions in the portfolio in the bad case scenario 
 While I totally agree that in case your short position is in loss, you need to add more funds to your account due to margin call, I can't agree on the calculation of weight of this position in the portfolio 
 I think that the best way to compare 2 portfolios in your example, is to look at their values at liquidation and what will be the weights of the positions in this case 
 If we assume that we wish to liquidate a portfolio with a short position, which faced a loss of $20, we will get $80 instead of our initial investment of $100. Thus, the weight of this short position in the final cash from liquidation of the portfolio will be lower and not higher as you mentioned in the example 
 So, from my point of view, in your example, the value of the short portfolio is artificially increased by $40, since it seems for an investor, that portfolio is worth $1000, but when she tries to liquidate it, it will worth only $960. Thank you in advance for your feedback 
 Kind regards, Ilya"

 However, I think the missing link is in the words 
 The inverse proportion of price to interest rate refers to an existing bond, already issued 
 This happens in comparison to raised bonds 
 If you're holding a bond paying 10% annually for 1000, then interest rates change and a new one is issued paying 13% for 1000, yours is less attractive and therefore cannot be sold at 1000, must be discounted to be attractive to market

  In 2007 , (P/E) ratio Price increases (say from 100 to 110) but Earnings of company increases more (say from 50 to 100) so ratio of P/E decreases compare to 2004 and Investor gets more values as he has more claim on company resources, compare to 2004(Final P/E value 110/100)

7949,43,1224,0,2016-02-18 14:40:36,"Hi Tran 
 The reasoning of Poloko is correct 
 In Michel's example, the timeline is important:   First he holds a bond with an annual coupon rate of 2% (say he bought it at 1000$ an it yields 20$ each year) 
    Then a new bond from the same issuer and the same time to maturity comes into existence and is issued at a price of 1000$ and a yearly coupon of 30$ 
    The two bonds will not coexist at the same price because they are perfectly identical, except for their yield 
 Thus the bond Michel holds has to drop in price to remain equally attractive as the new bond to other investors 
 And so it will drop in price to a level so that it also yields 3% 
  The intuitive reasoning behind this is that two assets that provide the same cash flows must have the same price 
 I hope this helps

 The assumptions would be: the comparable companies should be in the same industry (some types of operational risks) 
  Same stage of development (exp: growing companies) Similar financial structure 
 2 
 During the financial crisis when all company are't performing, it's also important to look into company's management to see if it's suitable to lead 
 Or when the market is overvalued

 On Gold, I use it as long term insurance (LTI) 
  not as an investment 
 Both methods need a valuation Monetarily, Gold @ $1,181/oz and global supply at ~5.9 Billion oz 
 We have ~$7Trillion in gold 
 Well, if the  Global M1 money supply is $20Trillion & M2 is $48Trillion 
  The price of gold needs to increase 10X.  Possibility-perhaps 
 As we know from Accounting,  cash assets +  non-cash assets =liabilities +owners equity 
 So, increase one side and the other side must also go up 
 Any takers for either side 
 Let's use F&C's (Floors & Ceilings) 
  Take an exchange traded fund (ETF) like GLD and tract it for the highs (Ceilings) & lows (Floors) 
   As LTI.  one can   use F&C's over a long period of time (historical of course) and buy GLD near the low. Later when the price reaches an amount you are comfortable with (insurance wise) 
  sell it and put in in a safe place until you need it 
 As an investment, similar process 
 But here one needs to determine their Minimum acceptable Rate Of Return (MARR) + use F&C's to follow a trend that produces your MARR 
 This may be short or long term 
 Keep in mind that long term may be a very long time 
 So choose wisely 
 Now, if all you want is to get a market return 
 Then, why are you looking at GLD? just use SPY. This is an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 (an indicator of the Market) 
  They are both volatile but the SPY is more stable 
 Depending on your time horizon 
 One may be more advantageous than the other 
 Historical F&C's 1) 
  Buy  GLD in 2010  @ $100. Sell in 2012 @ $175 for a 32% CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) 
   2) 
   Buy  GLD in 2010  @ $100. Sell in Feb 2016 @ $114 for a 2% CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) 
  3) 
  Buy  GLD in Jan 2016 @ $105.  In Feb 2016 it is $114. This is 8.57%  Bottom line 
 Be realistic (rational), understand your needs first 
 Invest much later"

 However, the other two answers are correct because ""expensive"" & ""cheaper"" index can always become both more so depending if the earnings of the companies within this index move in a greater proportion (percentage) than the price move of the index 
 Question 8 The correct answers are: A) Over this time\nperiod, there was a greater chance of observing extremely bad monthly returns\n(more negative than -20%) than extremely good monthly returns (more positive\nthan 20%) 
  B) Over this time period, there was a 80% chance of observing a monthly\nreturn between -10% and 10% 
  Rationale: A) is correct because if we look at the histogram there are no observations on the right side, where the returns have been more than +20% 
  B) is correct because if we combine the frequency of the two histogram bars, which are both 40% we end up with 80% of all observation of the data

 We know that if we buy a bond we love to have the lower inflation the possible to not erode the value 
 But inflation is influenced by interest rate, as bonds 
 So if central bank lower the rate, your bond already issued is gaining value, but also the inflation is going up 
 Let's say you have a zero coupon bond at 3 years with 5 % interest attached, you purchased it at 100 and the principal will pay back so 115 in three years 
 The inflation originally was at 1% 
  Now the day after the central bank lower the rates 
 The new bonds now are at 3% so with 100 you are getting 109 in three years, and your bond now has a today value of 105. The inflation has gone up to 2% due to the reduction of rate 
 You can keep your bond up to the end --> You get your 115 in three years but if nothing happens the new inflation have eroded part of your value You can sell immediately --> you get 105 while yesterday you spent 100 so you have an immediate gain of 5 that will lose in the years the value due to highly inflation unless you invest in something that benefit from higher inflation (stocks?) In any case if the raise of inflation is too much is there the possibility that new bond with lower rates into an higher inflation reality will become marginal and so the market will not be so happy to accept it

8009,1380,36,0,2016-04-06 23:17:04,"I think it depends on what you are hedging against and what you want this hedge (insurance) to accomplish 
 I tend to think of insurance as something I purchase in case a certain event happens 
 The more likely the event - the more expensive the insurance (e.g 
 Health and auto insurance), the less likely the cheaper the policy (e.g 
 Fire insurance) 
   However,  hedging is not quite the same 
 You are buying gold because historically it is uncorrelated with certain events - but the magnitude of this seems unpredictable 
 In the ""Gold as a hedge against stock market crashes"" example in the lecture you would need to have 50% in gold to offset a crash - which seems like way too much money  = however if you were looking to simply ease the pain of this event - then the ""How much gold"" question would be very much based on one's tolerance for pain 
 E.g 
 100 in stocks becomes 60 after a 40% decline, 90/10 stocks to gold would become 68 (assuming -40/+40) and 80/20 would yield 76 in this scenario 
 If your ""pain"" tolerance is high - zero gold seems fine, and as it gets lower - add more gold"

  By the way, as far as I understand, for most of the people a static portfolio that performs well in almost all the circumstances, must include a share of gold, that could range from approximately 10% up to 20-25% 
  To provide some examples, the All Weather portfolio of legendary investor Ray Dalio, includes 7.5% of gold (over 7.5% of commodities, 30% equity, 40% long-term bonds and the rest short-bonds) while Harry Browne's Permanent Portfolio has 25% (+ 25% stocks, 25% Government bonds and 25% cash)

 In year 1 you spent 150 (""-150"" in the chart) 
  In Year 1 you assume a cash inflow of 20, in year 2 an inflow of 50 etc.  These are cash flows in the future and you have to ""discount"" them to their present value (see   
  Here the discount rate is given as 10% (please don't ask me how to determine a reasonable discount rate in a real life situation. 
 ) The investment of the present does not need to be discounted, therefore we take it as -150.  The cash inflow of year 1 needs to be discounted with the discount rate ot 10% per year, for the duration of 1 year 
 10%=0.1, the discount formula for 1 year is ""inflow of year 1 / (1+discount rate) 
  Filling in the numbers: 20/(1+0.1) = 20/1.1 = 20/1.10 = 18.181818 
 The inflow of year 2 needs to be discounted with the discount rate of 10% per year, for the duration of 2 years, that means ""inflow / [(1+discount rate)*(1+discount rate)]"" 
  That is the same as ""inflow / [(1+discount rate)]^2"" 
  Filling in the numbers: 50/[1.10^2] 
   Generally speaking the discount formula is ""inflow of year N / [(1+discount rate)^N] 
  You do that for each year and sum it all up"
8049,1118,568,0,2017-04-05 17:44:15,"The question is posed as an “either/or”\nchoice, as if we only have to be concerned with one or the other of the\noutcomes 
 On the contrary, from what I\nhave studied (1), I believe that the American authorities had no choice but to\nact as they did, and that Moral Hazard and lack of responsible regulation has\nto be a continuing concern, regardless of any effects from the actions taken 
 The actions taken, 2007-2009: The actions\nwere not taken just for the well-being of the economy – as if they were addressing\nonly a sort of economic cough; the crisis of 2008 was a major systemic\ncrisis which would have degenerated into another depression equal to the Great\nDepression of 1929 (2) 
  In fact, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)\ndid take some “haircut” actions initially, only to realize that they were making\nthe crisis worse 
 The paradox, as Timothy Geithner - American Secretary of the\nTreasury at the time - has noted, is that, to prevent the enormous damage\nthreatened by a major systemic crisis, one is forced to do the opposite\nof what is normally required in a minor crisis; despite the Moral Hazard that\nthis implies 
 Finally, we should not forget the positive side: the actions\ntaken seem to have brought the American economy into positive recovery zone\nwithin 4 years; which appears to be an impressive record when compared to the\naftermath of other world crises (1) 
    Potential Consequences of Actions Taken:\nthe argument that the actions taken only “incentivized banks to be careless”\nseems to be somewhat simplified 
 Consider that:  ·     \nSuch an assumption is not an obvious\nconclusion 
 After all, the American authorities did let a number of companies\nfail: Lehman Brothers (too big to be allowed to fail class) and other\ninstitutions such as IndyMac and Washington Mutual 
 This leaves a doubt: who\nwould be protected in the future 
 ·     \nCompanies that are bailed out are\nstill required to repay the amounts advanced; ·     \nThe reforms contained in the\nDodd Frank Act (2010) address many of the defects in the system; ·     \nThe actions taken in 2007-2009\ndid not initiate the Risk of Moral Hazard 
 This has always been a concern and\nwill continue to be 
 We have learned to\ncontrol certain crises but the actors in the system are forever innovating and\nwill find new ways of creating Risk 
 Even now the push is on for President\nTrump to repeal Dodd Frank 
 Some of the concluding comments of Secretary\nGeithner (1) are relevant: “Risk will find its way around … constraints 
 Risk\ncan migrate”; and “Don’t have too much confidence in the power of the\nregulatory safeguards”

 To add to what Abelardo posted 
 My thoughts are going foreward,  you can not un-ring a bell 
 A better question could be, why did our regulators allow these synthetic CDOs & CDS to begin with and what is an appropriate fiscally responsible strategy 
 In the US we now have more regulatory hurdles like Dodd-Frank, Basel accords, etc.  Some good and some not. Dodd Frank becomes more restrictive for small & medium banks in the coming years 
 Basel Accords are similar 
 A small bank ($1B) with a 4.5% RWA (Risk Weighted Assets) + 2.5% CCB (Capital Conservation Buffer) + 2.5% CB (Counter Cyclical Buffer) is severely hobbled when compared to a large bank ($50B)  with the same requirements 
 Historical case in point: Merger of Citicorp (commercial bank holding company) with Travelers (Insurance company) in 1998 
 This violated The Glass-Stegall Act of 1956 
 The Federal Reserve gave Citigroup a temporary waiver in 1998.\n Less than a year later, the GLBA ( Gramm-Leach-Biley-Act)  was passed to legalize these on a permanent basis 
 US President Barack Obama has stated that GLBA led to deregulation that,\n among other things, allowed for the creation of giant financial \nsupermarkets that could own investment banks, commercial banks and \ninsurance firms, something banned since the Great Depression of 1929 
 Many others also say it cleared the way for companies that were  to big and interconnected to fail thus requiring massive bailouts to remain solvent 
 The Nobel prize  winning Economist Joseph Stigiltz has also argued that the GBLA helped to create the banking crisis  To be fair 
 It is also true  that the US banking system was becoming less competitive on the international circuit 
 So, reform was needed 
 However,  it is one thing for an Ikea like storefront to offer goods & services from A to Z under one roof 
 It is an entirely different matter for banks to offer their customers these A to Z goods & services under one roof with uncontrolled  leverage or by bundling them with a synthetic wrapper just because they wanted to find a way to make more money 
 As Einstein foretold; the mistake with uncertainty  is the belief that there is an antidote 
 My bottom line: The bailout should not have been necessary and we need a culture of both appropriate regulations and fiscal responsibility to ensure that we work together using a multidisciplinary approach rather than a nail & hammer ideology

 Personally, I would have preferred a ¨bailout¨ of homeowners by the federal government--with taxpayer dollars--bailing out homeowners by taking over property, buying out the bank interest in the property with perhaps 25 percent of the mortgage, and then writing down the value of the property and extending new credit to the homeowner directly from the Federal Government 
 Some would argue that this would place the Federal Government into the direct mortgage business, however as the Tax Collector it can always recoup on anyone who would then default on a loan--for the rest of the person´s life 
 I do disagree with the Financial Sector bailout to the banks which is a preferred SECTOR of the economy and the people, in real terms of persons and personnel far fewer than the 330 Million residents of the country 
 The famous ¨bailout¨, actually there were several ¨bailouts¨ to banks and industries was the incorrect path, but the power structure in 2007 and 2008 favored a bailout of the rich and wealthy bankers and their friends over any kind of bailout, or direct national refinancing program to troubled homeowners 
 Instead the choice was made to let these homeowners go under by the Millions and then hand over more than a Trillion dollars in financial bailouts, 1, and 2, and Auto Industry to the corporations over the people

 Which stock is cheap and which is expensive based on what you have paid for $1 of earnings

  Earnings are what drives the growth of a business 
 With their earnings, a company invests in new buildings and equipment, buy other businesses, pay dividends, etc. The earnings are not directly paid to investors, but are put to work in the  business that will, hopefully, earn a high rate of return 
 This is why we invest in stocks 
 This is why, in the future, other investors will buy our shares  for more than we paid 
 We don't know what our future ROI will be when we make an investment 
 We have to make  investing decisions based on what we know today"

 3) ratios could not be used and multiple-based valuation would be useful to understand how far is the Company from being in the arena 
 I would investigate more on the reasons 
 Like: If also other similar Companies are in the same situation then the industry is under a crises and I would not invest"
8160,129,356,0,2016-07-02 14:11:14,"The first part of the decision is what amount (in USD) we cannot afford to lose 
 Let's say we have total wealth of 100,000 and the iron reserve is 30,000. That already tells us that gold should be at a minimum of 30% 
  There is no point to weigh by probability of black swans here, because the definition of ""iron reserve"" is that under any circumstances can it be risked 
 Let's make two further assumptions: (a) the observed historic rate of return of non-gold portfolio is 10% and (b) in case of a black swan we lose 75% of our capital invested in non-gold assets 
 So now we have 70,000 USD remaining risk capital 
 If we include another 10,000 USD in gold out of that risk capital we are losing the upside opportunity, which is equal to the share of gold out of the risk money X the observed historic return in other investments, i.e.:   Share of gold out of risk capital = 10 / 70 = 14%\n   Historic return of portfolio ex 
 Gold = 10%\n   Then the opportunity cost of this 10K invested in gold is 1.4pp negative of the final return\n   This opportunity cost would increase as we increase the share of gold, e.g 
 If we invest everything in gold, the opportunity cost would be equal to 100%x10% = 10pp negative - what we would have made if we invested everything in non-gold portfolio 
 (The opportunity cost for the initial 30,000 USD iron reserve allocation is 0% because it is not really an option to invest it, therefore nothing to lose by holding it.) If for a moment we assume that black swan cannot happen, increasing the gold position to about 45K (on top of the initial 30k) we will get 0% return precisely because of the opportunity cost, therefore gold should not exceed that dollar amount 
 On the other extreme if we want to maximize our returns we should invest all 70,000 in non-gold assets 
 Three final considerations:   If we believe that the probability of a black swan is above ~13% (the cut off point using the assumptions above) we should not invest in the stock market at all, as the probability-weighted loss from a black swan will wipe out the probability-weighted investment returns.\n   The percentage share of gold in our portfolio also depends on the size of the entire portfolio, e.g 
 If we have $500,000 capital to invest and iron reserve requirement of $50,000 this gives us minimum gold requirement of 10% (unlike the 30% in the first example) 
    We may argue that in a black swan scenario we will not lose everything (e.g 
 We will save 25% of 70,000 = 17,500) and therefore our iron reserve should be 30 - 17.5 = 12.5, but that really depends on the interpretation of 'iron' in iron reserve and 'black' in black swan

 If you could make a return of say 15% in the stock market in one year, while gold ony delivers say 2% in a ""normal"" year but then 200% in an extreme case, it might be worth holding a relatively large portion if statistically the probability of an extreme event raises

8214,847,1266,0,2017-07-21 06:13:25,"Theoretically, if you bought a bond with a yield-to-maturity of 10% and later the government or the corporation issued a new bond with a yield-to-maturity of 12%, to sell the earlier bond, that yields 10%, you have to reduce the price for the total return to be equal to the  total return from the new issue at 12% 
   I couldn't comprehend the mathematical derivation of it, even though it cited approximation 
 The formula given was approximate new price =  -D (duration)  X ( delta r/(1+r)) X 100. Here, the duration is point in time at which the present values of cash flows before  and after the point are equal 
 Delta- r is the change in interest rate or yield-to-maturity and r is the earlier yield-to-maturity 
 To decipher the equation, the fraction that the change in interest rate is of the principal + old interest rate multiplied by the number of years to the equilibrium multiplied by hundred gives us the amount by which the value of the earlier bond must be reduced for it to equate to the new bond, right 
 It doesn't matter if we don't take discounted cash flows for the sake of simplicity, but the fact is that since we are only accounting for price till the equilibrium point, we might still have a few coupons at the old rate past the equilibrium point (at least, one for the maturity year, and possibly more), so you're not accounting for the interest rate differential past the equilibrium point 
 This is a very rough approximation, so would this be of  use  only for comparison or actual pricing

  The terminal value Vn is used for an extended forecast horizon longer than say 5 years simplifying our assumptions that these future cash flows that are further away in future are growing at a constant rate gFCF  Vn= ((1+gFCF)/(rWACC-gFCF))*FCFN Where FCFn is the Future cash flow of the last period year given  Now to calculate the price of one share we need the Firm Value which is represented by V0 Vo= (FCF/(1+rWACC))+(FCF2/(1+rWACC)^2))+ 
 +(FCFn+Vn/(1+rWACC)^n) Now once we get the firm value we can now calculate the price of one share Po by subtracting the value of debt of the firm and dividing the number by total no of outstanding shares

 Obtain Future EPS by Growing EPS for 10 years (use calculator or rule of 72) 4 
 Determine future P/E (Price/Earnings) multiple (2x the growth rate from #2 or double historical P/E-conservative) Maximum of 50 5 
 Multiply future EPS and future P/E to get future sticker price 6 
 Default MARR (Minimal Accepted Rate of Return) is 15% 7 
 Discount future sticker price by MARR 
 Then divide by 4 =sticker price 8 
 MOS is 50% 9

 My observations/questions are:  1 
 Since ECB created this money as part of the QE to buy bonds, their negative yields are only on numerical calculations, therefore, they don't really get less than paid in to acquire these bonds in real actual money terms 
 2 
 The risk for buying market quoted negative YTM bonds are highly risky if yield curve changes direction when ECB stops the QE bond purchasing program and start to increase interest rate"

 The case for the subprime crisis can hardly be a direct fault of global access but rather the greed to manipulate and bend the rules for short-term gain while recognizing this phenomenon can last forever without any recourse 
 Global access has greatly benefitted economies such as during the late 70's our automobile production began to trade quality for quantity resulting in consumers wanting a better reliable auto and in this case started purchasing Japanese products because they're goods were better quality 
 This boosted the Japanese economy while our economy still rallied in the 80's/90's leading to the dot com bubble"

  Though it will cost me a point, I will not answer the question of week 1 regarding return/risk ratio (whether one should choose the country with the highest ratio) with yes. It is just plain wrong 
 Asymptotically, when the risk goes to zero, the risk becomes irrelevant (i.e.: the growth equals (1+x)^n, with n the number of years, with ignorable spread) 
  For small enough n, it does not matter whether the risk is 0.1% or 0.01%, and one will just choose the highest return 
 What would you rather choose: a return of 10% with a risk of 1% or a return of 1% with a risk of 0.01% 
  Under no circumstance the latter, I presume

 In that case ​a return distribution will be characterized by frequent small losses and a few large gains 
 However, all four moments (mean, standard deviation, skewness and​s) are important 
 In general, people are risk averse 
 So, keeping  mean,variance and kurtosis constant, positive skewness is preferable, because while a small chance of large wins might not be that good, a small chance of large losses is still really bad.  For more info you can check the following link: 1

8983,3018,73,2,2018-02-19 22:24:46,"I would opt for small part to insure against black swan, and maybe hedge again money that seems to decrease  with the conviction that these assets are ultimately the ones that will enhance your living standard because they are supposed to reward you for your invested capital 
 In case of insability , I will increase this proportion"
8984,4193,1287,1,2016-12-03 16:11:17,Yes
8985,1830,31,1,2016-10-12 17:46:00,"I believe bailout of financial sector was simply necessary for the economy 
 Since the crisis was too big to handled by their own, if they were left untouched by government the whole system may have collapsed 
 Yes there is some worries but I believe government should look for the greater picture which is to revive the economy"
8986,838,147,1,2016-08-06 18:20:51,Yes
8987,2995,98,1,2016-11-13 03:40:14,"I think yes,"
8988,4194,99,1,2016-08-30 04:18:32,Yes it was
8989,674,116,1,2016-06-26 16:32:02,"The main assumption is that similar companies will perform similarly 
 Yes, during the dot com bubble for instance as these companies had little or no earnings"
8990,4173,192,1,2016-09-04 01:21:11,Yes
8991,4195,501,1,2018-07-10 14:42:10,Yes
8992,48,1288,1,2017-08-04 09:54:01,"Some of the countries yes  
  but the most of the countries use for the trades the us dollars"
8993,1686,173,1,2016-12-29 22:16:49,"The overall context of the market 
 Yes in several occasions and depending on the company industry 
 Probably all ratios and results will be negative, and there for we could not invest, or buy"
8994,3633,19,1,2016-04-24 23:51:42,Yes
8995,3984,499,1,2018-08-02 05:53:52,"Yes that is why P/E ratios are not always applicable 
 The use of comparables might be another way to do this"
8996,4196,99,1,2016-09-20 04:47:23,"Yes, but with more regulations imposed"
8997,3394,197,1,2018-01-06 12:41:07,"Yes 
 The action was well thoughtful 
 If it didn't do the same, it would have taken more time to revive the economy"
8998,4197,507,1,2016-04-17 06:37:53,"Yes, i also Note It"
8999,4198,60,1,2017-06-30 18:17:57,Yes
9000,4199,149,1,2016-06-27 06:36:27,Yes
9001,4200,989,1,2016-01-27 02:17:51,"Hello Dave, Yes I saw it 
 And my question stands"
9002,2648,31,1,2016-10-25 08:10:18,"Yes,i believe that the decision of us government was correct"
9003,3870,145,1,2016-02-22 14:26:11,"Both yes and no 
 I believe it was necessary at the beginning, to kickstart the economy 
 But eventually there is to much debt around 
 Who is going to take the bill 
 The consequence if they stop now is probably a new financial crisis 
 But in the long run, maybe that's a good thing 
 To get a clean and fresh start 
 But hopefully the economies with these quantities easing around the world will pick up again, unless we end up in a secular stagnation"
9004,2664,54,1,2017-10-17 11:13:06,Yes
9005,192,98,1,2016-11-13 13:16:42,Yes
9006,89,288,1,2016-02-28 06:03:28,"Yes not ""printed"" currency in circulation for goods inflation, but  maybe  and just maybe inmaterial printing pushing assets inflation"
9007,1170,677,1,2016-12-12 16:02:40,"Yes, it's necessary for the revival of the economy, but has to be done under no political bias condition 
 The way the CB's choose as to whom to rescue and whom not to by asset purchases is politically influenced then they are kind of controlling who stays in the market despite not being cautious enough 
 All of them have to be given an equal chance"
9008,4201,99,1,2016-08-25 12:31:00,Yes i think so
9009,3085,79,1,2018-07-14 18:24:17,"Because there are multiple variables that play a factor in the process of  evaluating a company 
 And yes, in the past there was a time were you could not trust the multiple-based valuation method to give you a fair value 
 For example, the  _domain_  bubble, or the housing crisis"
9010,3134,145,1,2016-03-05 20:17:48,Sometimes yes. Sometimes - no
9011,4202,197,1,2017-12-30 22:13:26,Yes
9012,1140,99,1,2016-09-13 02:19:12,"It would be prudent to think of the potential consequences of this bailout in 2008 because yes, the banks will have bad incentives because of this but as we all know, the financial sector was in need at the time 
 It's the governments job to regulate in such a way that the financial sector can't just wander of to do bad things with tax money which they got from the bail-out"
9013,3700,289,1,2016-09-28 10:24:01,"Yes, I can agree with you. I did Introduction to Corporate Finance and Financial Markets here on Coursera and I must say that knowledge I gain there helped me to understand what was said in the lectures here"
9014,505,66,1,2016-02-14 17:32:57,"Yes me as well I am a real beginner 
 If you can tell us how you've gotten to the answer 
 Thank  you"
9015,116,101,1,2016-01-27 04:44:45,"Yes, I am an Investment Manager (IM) 
  There are many different kinds 
 I am a value investor and a Fiduciary 
 Here is our website"
9016,36,98,1,2016-11-13 20:37:45,"Yes, it was necessary to bail out banks or else the repercussions on Main street would have been larger than what would have happened on Wall Street"
9017,4203,9,1,2016-04-25 22:08:16,"Yes, it was necessary this time to bail them out, but lessons need to be learn for the future so that governments are not compelled to save the banks, or that banks are not in a position to bring down countries"
9018,2886,369,1,2017-07-31 10:31:41,"Yes, I believe in a safe investment strategy and hence would invest a high proportion of money in gold"
9019,1486,661,1,2018-08-27 19:52:51,Yes
9020,3746,145,1,2016-03-06 15:28:41,Yes
9021,1990,266,1,2016-07-29 02:29:16,"The assumption is that markets are low efficient, making it easy to make reliable predictions based on its performance 
 Yes, I wouldn't feel comfortable using multiple-based valuation methods during every bubble in history 
 These methods were unable to predict the extreme losses that the market suffered when those bubbles bursted"
9022,197,904,1,2017-08-11 08:40:21,"Yes, after the video is downloaded, it can be watched offline 
 Open the Coursera app, then:  Select ""Downloads"" or ""Resume Course"" -> Understanding Financial Markets -> [subsection of course, e.g 
 Major Financial Markets (week 2)] -> select title of video to watch The phone symbol with the X mark after downloading is to delete the video from the phone"
9023,2147,240,1,2017-08-30 05:16:13,Yes i would have a large part of portfolio invested in gold
9024,3220,98,1,2016-11-07 18:54:28,Yes they need to be more careful in their investment activity and not just depend on the government bailout if things go wrong
9025,4204,7,1,2016-04-02 15:01:15,Yes
9026,2002,124,1,2016-08-18 15:13:37,Yes because bank are the backbones of every economy if bank are not functoining well the economy will go in trouble.
9027,768,554,1,2016-03-02 20:45:34,"Yes, I believe it was necessary to bail out the banks, however it is also a bad incentive for the banks 
 An alternative mechanism needs to be found and tried"
9028,716,961,1,2016-02-02 21:22:38,"Yes thank you. You are right for all three, I made it too quickly"
9029,2802,149,1,2016-06-21 14:46:13,Yes\n
9030,4205,149,1,2016-06-06 13:07:50,Yes
9031,4206,520,1,2018-01-23 10:57:11,Yes
9032,152,145,1,2016-03-05 00:42:07,"Yes i think the solution chosen was not he best 
 An alternate solution should have been used where more of the bailout would be towards the regular taxpayers than the banks that were at the center of the crisis to begin with"
9033,701,431,1,2017-09-28 16:56:47,"I fully agree that the measures taken by the Federal reserve and the treasury Dept with the tarp and qe helped the US economy from Total disaster 
 Yes in the process a few unnecessary elements in the economy got bailed out. But overall this was a great move and would helped if the rest of the world especially EU food suit sooner than later"
9034,2639,398,1,2017-06-17 16:21:32,"Yes, There is no information given about how to measure it or how it is measured 
 Would be interesting to know, even though the number myabe given if you look for it in the internet"
9035,4207,134,1,2016-03-10 19:47:03,"Sales yield, divident yield etc. Yes, can't feel comfortable, yes, that means no terminal for company if it report less, so DCF valuation has disadvantages"
9036,4190,262,1,2018-03-14 03:16:25,"The assumption is that other enterprises in the same industry can be used as ""comparable enterprises"" to be appraised 
 Yes"
9037,4208,117,1,2016-05-25 12:15:01,"Yes from the CB point of view , bad from tax payers point of view  
  Over all as long as NPA's are under control for the lending banks , the CB seems to feel that they are doing the job but its not a guarantee that it will revive the economic growth "
9038,2822,9,1,2016-04-03 15:50:21,"Yes 
 Managerial hubris, people will always be greedy and mankind's reach always exceeds his grasp"
9039,2215,292,1,2016-06-21 00:18:36,"Yes, governments need to intervene in markets when necessary to help adjust the imbalances, stabilize the  economy and create incentive for the investors 
 However, it requires a more precise supervision for risks and well-functioning of market agents"
9040,4209,1289,1,2016-05-18 16:29:04,"Hi Gagandeep, Yes, you can purchase the certificate later 
 I know that for a fact but I'm mot sure how to do it though 
 You might wanna check the Help Center for that 
 Regards, Nora"
9041,131,353,1,2016-02-15 16:26:46,"Yes had realised my problem was converting % numbers 
 Re did it and got 1742"
9042,3247,447,1,2017-05-29 03:57:39,"YES, I DO BELIEVE THAT SUCH BAILOUT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE ECONOMY'S WELL BEING"
9043,3681,338,1,2016-05-26 14:15:43,"Yes, i think the bailout was necessary to help stimulate economic growth"
9044,2754,259,1,2018-08-06 08:25:00,"Yes it was necessary 
 And the Government should be cautious when it was happening 
 The simple answer is the Government is paying because it regulatory body is inefficient"
9045,2986,250,1,2018-10-05 13:49:47,"Yes, I would be more worried about bad consequences of this bailout 
 I would more rely on Swedish solution - the partial nationalization of banks who failed"
9046,48,32,1,2016-06-25 17:08:37,Yes i finished the Melbourne specialization but its different thing the corporate finance from investment managent
9047,62,535,1,2016-02-04 08:33:58,"Yes, Dave I received also response from the flag reports 
 That is nice to have that kind of feedback"
9048,821,959,1,2016-04-23 20:03:35,"Yes, I agree that the modeling seems to be a way of making you comfortable with a bunch of assumptions made 
 I hope to see some probability modeling introduced in this course at some point 
 Something like how insurance companies must model the risk of a particular contract"
9049,4210,62,1,2018-07-23 07:04:46,Yes
9050,2607,144,1,2017-08-27 11:20:30,"Yes, to some extend 
 If there is not a buy-back option."
9051,352,284,1,2018-03-21 10:06:28,"Yes, hence probably couldn't completely trust the statistically calculated value"
9052,131,1278,1,2017-05-08 12:22:07,"Thank you for you response Nicholas Yes that is a very compelling argument, the accessibility of markets globally has benefited a lot, but as much as it has spread gains, my question was has it also spread risk, regardless of the source of the risk 
 What do you think 
 Others can join our discussion too"
9053,3613,501,1,2018-08-08 07:52:09,"Yes sure, I think my worry is the long term effect this will have on the economy related to investments and retirement planning, who will be paying the bill in 20-30 years from now. Having a big-brother to bail you out is not always a good thing - shouldn't  policy alone be driving worsening economic conditions as a pre-warning to banks and institutions that something is going to break"
9054,4211,90,1,2018-02-26 20:35:23,"As a mechanical engineer I am not quite sure about this method, because I find it hard to imagine that in which niveau shall two firms be considered as ""comparable"" 
  There are too many features people can use to evaluate a firm 
 And yes, if a company is suffering from a loss, the method would be default, so that we should use other model to find the answer"
9055,3564,330,1,2017-06-16 15:37:04,Yes
9056,3471,146,1,2018-10-27 10:43:45,"Yes true there could be different market conditions, geographical location also play an impact"
9057,4212,143,1,2018-02-10 00:03:16,Yes
9058,1471,749,1,2016-07-30 16:46:45,Yes ofcourse and even it had remove all the confuSion abd cleared all the basic concept too. thank you COURSERA
9059,4213,46,1,2017-04-01 15:05:30,"Yes, I think the banks will engage in risky behaviors because they can assume that the government will just bail them out when they get in trouble"
9060,1824,852,1,2017-11-25 04:40:44,"Yes he must have made a mistake there 
 And his statements are sometimes confusing also 
 The explanations are not clear at times 
 I wish there would have been a means to reach them"
9061,48,1290,1,2017-03-24 15:33:57,"Yes the cash on the bank has lower risk and lower return than goverment bonds 
 The first will money from the  bankrupt  of the bank is the shareholders"
9062,1545,130,1,2018-02-20 06:59:32,Yes
9063,513,247,1,2017-11-12 13:35:46,"We are assuming that the earnings will stay relatively stable  
  Yes, 2007 or during any bubble"
9064,563,395,1,2018-09-01 03:13:37,Yes
9065,4214,97,1,2016-08-03 02:25:53,"Yes, but not so much because of the cost of opportunity 
 Portfolio means diversification, so we must diversify the investments analizing very confident information"
9066,1732,30,1,2016-10-04 03:43:15,"Yes 
 But I believe it is some necessary bad incentive to prevent the economy from going too bad. As we learned in this session, the capability of the Central Bank to boost the economy is limited compared to its utility in cooling down overheating economy"
9067,1930,119,1,2016-11-20 12:12:31,Yes  I believe it is more important to  be a well functional bank or else the people will wont be having trust on central bank
9068,4215,171,1,2016-07-27 10:21:26,"Yes but only when i have +$100 million 
 \n"
9069,2677,399,1,2017-07-18 01:25:56,"Hi Michelle, In a word, YES. But nuance exists between these 2 terms 
 Check it out:"
9070,1735,9,1,2016-04-01 03:06:16,I think the US government may have had little choice however the optics of the bailout were very bad to the average taxpayer and yes it may have created a problem with incentive to manage risk on loans down the road
9071,4216,520,1,2018-01-11 08:02:20,"Yes, it could be considered necessary during the crisis to bring the economic growth"
9072,1864,504,1,2018-08-10 06:43:28,"The assumption is that the comparable companies are fairly valued by the market  
  The management and technoloigies are similar 
 Yes distortions can occur due to negatives earnings in a year as well as miss reporting of profits,"
9073,1936,280,1,2016-09-13 06:40:07,Yes DCF valuation method is not an easy task!
9074,4059,92,1,2017-10-05 11:13:19,Yes
9075,2526,292,1,2016-06-28 06:16:12,Yes it is worrisome if there are no tighter controls put in place as a result
9076,1234,395,1,2018-09-03 06:13:08,"Actually yes, as Gov. may put some restrictions and not making any calculus for its decisions which leads to corruption"
9077,4217,208,1,2018-02-25 16:53:53,Yes
9078,4063,77,1,2016-07-27 12:19:39,Yes
9079,4218,178,1,2016-04-30 21:17:16,"Yes, they do give incentives to the investment banks"
9080,2929,294,1,2016-08-31 23:21:24,"We make the assumption that the statements from the companies reflect all the information of a company 
 Yes, for example in a crisis 
 Maybe use another methods of comparing companies"
9081,1154,5,1,2017-07-26 13:21:46,Yes bailout was necessary to jumpstart the economy by investing in companies that were almost going out of business this brought in more labor and money in circulation which has positive returns in the long run
9082,3289,390,1,2018-11-01 19:43:23,"Yes with that kind of solutions you introduce bad incentives to the economy 
 Moral hazard or too big to fail banks are threats to the capitalism system"
9083,4219,145,1,2016-02-11 18:32:18,Yes
9084,4215,124,1,2016-07-27 13:35:37,"Yes, it was necessary to keep the people employed."
9085,116,58,1,2016-02-01 16:39:59,"Hi Lorric Yes, it would be nice to have more quizzes that dive deeper into the concepts 
 Keep in mind the peer review assignment, level of course, time constraints, etc"
9086,1095,348,1,2018-11-08 16:44:36,"I think the measures taken by the government in terms of preventing the worsening of stagnation were quite reasonable 
 Yes, the banks may became more careless and wait for the help of the government, but this is what was needed to be done and this is a function of the government to do so and interfere macro economically"
9087,1210,178,1,2016-05-07 17:05:51,"Yes, It was necessary but now it's time to go back to the ""new normal"""
9088,2050,161,1,2017-12-03 08:23:44,"Yes it was necessary 
 Having said that, what is also necessary is regulatory restrictions on over lending and improper risk underwriting"
9089,4004,292,1,2016-07-09 17:56:04,Yes
9090,2235,31,1,2016-10-28 03:16:08,"Yes, more worried"
9091,4220,724,1,2017-12-19 09:06:32,Yes
9092,903,257,1,2017-03-09 12:41:09,Yes
9093,1092,387,1,2018-02-16 12:47:08,"Yes The bailout of the sector was necessary 
 They couldn't another Lehmann and a complete collapse of system 
 The moral hazard part has been offset with tighter regular"
9094,2538,248,1,2018-11-03 11:25:42,"Yes, this was necessary"
9095,4221,846,1,2018-07-11 22:36:12,"Yes, I do believe so"
9096,3400,256,1,2016-08-13 13:51:21,Yes
9097,3927,119,1,2016-11-19 23:19:00,"Yes, it isn’t just the government bailout money that cost trillions, it also made banks too big to fail 
 Those big banks would not change their attitude of lies, cheating, and a multi-faceted corruption which was often criminal, if their regulators do no strengthen controls on their governance"
9098,1890,66,1,2016-02-12 13:00:06,"Yes I figured that, forgot that an integer means a whole number 
 Back to grammar school as well I guess 
 _smiley_"
9099,3587,145,1,2016-02-29 18:09:23,Yes
9100,1758,82,1,2016-09-11 22:50:07,"Yes, it is necessary to prevent another Great Recession, which could have far more negative impact to the country in the long term"
9101,2930,533,1,2017-04-04 12:18:01,"The ratios have been correctly determined 
 Yes, if earnings are lower than they should be, eg 
 During a recession, or loss of market confidence 
 The price should have adjusted in accordance with the reduced earnings, and hence the PE ratio should remain accurate"
9102,1731,24,1,2016-04-14 14:12:38,Yes because its role is very important in the national and global economy
9103,2508,504,1,2018-08-16 16:57:13,"Yes 
 I think the biggest problem is the market is unpredictable and it is hard to evaluate whether those two companies are comparable"
9104,1166,166,1,2016-02-19 22:49:17,"Yes it is multiple answers 
 Every answer is suggesting that only 1 variable has been estimated either up or down 
 So while selecting one answer you have to assume that all the other variables are estimated correctly"
9105,3715,851,1,2017-07-14 16:51:05,"Yes, it is very helpful and always opened in another tab while I'm watching the videos  _smiley_"
9106,575,120,1,2017-07-11 14:15:38,"I think it's more important that a major crisis has been averted

 So, in my opinion , it was right decision"

 About 3%"

9127,3433,313,1,2017-06-26 01:28:11,"Of course it was a BAD idea 
 Yes it stimulated the US economy, but the US economy has been under constant government stimulus since the Great Depression 
 It is as stimulated as a chimp with unlimited access to bananas laced with cocaine 
 But eventually the party will have to end.  And when the US economy shuts down like the Greek, the world will rue the day"

 I believe they are generated automatically by Coursera's platform, hence the errors which are probably exacerbated by the different foreign accents of our team of Professors 
 I intend to correct them at some point but I sadly have more urgent things on my plate right now. I hope the mistakes are more hilarious than detrimental for your understanding of the course

 Moreover, the banks can in consecuence not to take account of the cashflow cicle in the use of savings deposits of his clients"
9142,1315,34,1,2016-03-19 06:18:26,"Yes, the TARP program is the finest example of moral hazard 
 The very same investment banks that sought deregulation were confident that they would be bailed out by the government if their risky trading strategies collapsed 
 This perverse system ensured that not a single executive was prosecuted despite the part that they played in nearly destroying the financial system"
9143,4227,62,1,2018-07-17 07:38:09,Yes

 But this loss may be due to initial phase wherein sales volume is low or not enough to overcome the investment( cost) which is huge in one year itself"
9151,4231,149,1,2016-06-30 07:00:41,"Yes it was necessary at the time 
 As long as regulations are in place to prevent careless actions in future I don not feel that it creates bad incentives"
9152,4232,9,1,2016-04-02 17:25:42,Yes

9162,463,34,1,2016-03-20 20:50:54,"Yes, Aristeidis it is a great idea for some degree of interventionism is put in place to curtail their excesses 
 I wonder if any such interventionism exists 
 I don't think the terrible state of the bank's books was absolutely their fault since it was a result of the bubble in the 80s, however, if another bubble takes place, the US will still have to perform the ""TARP"" again 
 It seems more like a cycle to me"
9163,116,101,1,2016-01-27 04:26:02,"Yes to both

 (history does not repeat itself exactly the same way, but the results and the reasons are usually similar)"

9169,3618,292,1,2016-07-13 07:19:16,"I believe that those bailouts were indeed necessary to save our economy from going recession into depression 
 But government failed to keep accountable those guys, who were responsible for the crisis 
 And yes, that banks, which received bailouts and their CEOs received millions dollars in bonuses at the same time, their bailouts should be revoked asap"

9174,589,296,1,2018-06-18 10:07:53,"Yes, because the government in most cases takes an action, successful in short-term and then it might kick back"
9175,2659,19,1,2016-04-26 10:16:35,"Yes, I think it was necessary, because otherwise - ordinary people are the ones who would be affected by the recession 
 Bad incentives are also present, however, Central Banks must be very clear that this bail out is only a last resort, so that this will not be abused"

 Bad incentives to banks"
