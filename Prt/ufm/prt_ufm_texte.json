Amazon could be difficult as part of their strategy includes re-investing all their positive cashflows towards new products, research and development, and property, as examples \n Sometimes, it's hard to use PE ratios where there is no likely comparison \n Any values that result of that comparison will not help an investor reach a fair value \n Further, as a summary, I have found the following explanations as to why multiples can distort the full picture of a company's valuation \n There are a number of criticisms levied against multiples, but in the main these can be summarised as:   Simplistic: A multiple is a distillation of a great deal of information into a single number or series of numbers \n By combining many value drivers into a point estimate, multiples may make it difficult to disaggregate the effect of different drivers, such as growth, on value \n The danger is that this encourages simplistic – and possibly erroneous – interpretation \n Static: A multiple represents a snapshot of where a firm is at a point in time, but fails to capture the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of business and competition \n Difficulties in comparisons: Multiples are

carried out from a simple economic standpoint, but must consider its effects on public policy and sentiment as well \n During the time of the crises, the decision by the US Fed to come up with the TARP was necessary to allow liquidty to effectively be injected into the monetary system by increasing bank lending post-TARP \n Illiquidity at the time, aside from leding to tepid growth, was also leading to the meltdown of many aspects of the financial systems such as the money-markets \n At the end of the day if this was allowed to continue it would have led to solvency and operational cash issues for many companies \n Combine this with the interconnectivity of large institutions in the market through derivate products like Credit Default Swaps, and you now end up with the primary issue of insitutions that are Too-Interconnected-To-Fail (TIFF): a collapse of any one systematically important instituion would lead to a chain-reaction causing other connected instituion to collapse in tandem \n This TIFF problem was the main reason that the bailout was, at some level, necessary: a further meltdown would have had dire consequences on main street, wages, and employment levels with large corporations being the next in line to feel the brunt of a lack of operational liquidity following the banks \n The other side of this issue is that of moral-hazard: did this sentiment that the bank bailout was imminent spur such egregriously careless risk-taking by the banks, and will it continue to do so in the future \n Unfortunately, I beleive that this might still be the case \n Even though the US did implement the Dodd-Frank Act, asking structurally significant institutions to carve out a living-will and raised capital requirements for banks, little was done to sovle the core issue of TIFF \n Under current law, one can simply underwrite a derivate like a CDS without actually having to earmark any capital to cover the insurance capital that the CDS guarantees \n The total

high-reward proposition \n However, using an appropriate valuation method such as DCF or EV\/EBITDA, and following common-sense safeguards – such as evaluating risk-reward, assessing management capability, and using a portfolio approach – can lessen the risk of investing in such companies and make it a rewarding exercise \n •Is the unprofitable phase likely to be temporary or permanent \n For a mature company, a potential investor should determine whether the negative earnings phase is a temporary one, or if it signals a lasting, downward trend in the company’s fortunes \n If the company is a well-managed entity in a cyclical industry like energy or commodities, then it is likely that the unprofitable phase will only be temporary and the company will return to profitability in future \n •Early-stage companies are not for the conservative investor: It takes a leap of faith to put your savings in an early-stage company that may not report profits for years \n Investing in early-stage companies may be suitable for investors with a high tolerance for risk, but stay away if you are a very conservative investor \n •Check valuations and evaluate the risk-reward: The Company’s valuation should justify investment decision \n If the stock appears overvalued and there is a high degree of uncertainty about its business prospects, it may be a highly risky investment \n The risk of investing in an unprofitable company should also be more than offset by the potential return \n •Management is the key: Determine whether the management team has the credibility and skill to turn the company around (for a mature entity) or oversee its development through its growth phase to eventual profitability (for an early-stage company) \n  •Use a portfolio approach: When investing in negative earnings companies, a portfolio approach is highly recommended, since the success of even one company in the portfolio can be enough to offset the failure of a few other holdings

from recent RE price development in Russia \n In Russia we recently faced a number of factors: international sanctions and oil price shock led to increased outflow of capital from Russia which resulted in increased demand for foreign currency and substantial devaluation of Russian ruble \n Devaluation led to increased prices of imported products and to increased prices of domestic products as well, since domestic producers decided that they can increase prices and still remain competitive in comparison to imports \n As a result, inflation in the country increased sharply \n In such a situation it could be logical to assume that if someone invested in real estate in Russia before all these events, she could be ptotected from inflation \n However, what we witnessed in RE market after those events is that due to all these factors the purchasing power of Russian citizens decreased, since their daily expenses increased, so their demand for RE investments decreased as well \n Thus, not only the prices of RE assets have not been adjusted for devaluation, they fell even in RUR terms together with rental payments, which also fell \n Thus, for example, owners of flats, which let them for rent, not only were unprotected from inflation, but were hit by it and their investments decreased in value \n Here is a short article about the RE price movements in Russia:    So, it

deal of information into a single number or series of numbers \n By combining many value drivers into a point estimate, multiples may make it difficult to dis-aggregate the effect of different drivers, such as growth, on value \n The danger is that this encourages simplistic – and possibly erroneous – interpretation.\\n Static: A multiple represents a snapshot of where a firm is at a point in time, but fails to capture the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of business and competition.\\n Difficulties in comparisons: Multiples are primarily used to make comparisons of relative value \n But comparing multiples is an exacting art form, because there are so many reasons that multiples can differ, not all of which relate to true differences in value \n For example, different accounting policies can result in diverging multiples for otherwise identical operating businesses.\\n Dependence on correctly valued peers: The use of multiples only reveals patterns in relative values, not absolute values such as those obtained from discounted cash flow valuations \n If the peer group as a whole is incorrectly valued (such as may happen during a stock market \"bubble\") then the resulting multiples will also be misvalued.\\n Short-term: Multiples are based on historic data or near-term forecasts \n Valuations based on multiples will therefore fail to capture differences in

\"Several valuation methods are available, depending on a company’s industry, its characteristics (for example, whether it is a start-up or a mature company), and the analyst’s preference and expertise \n In this chapter and the rest of the book, we focus on the mainstream valuation methods \n These methods are classified into four categories, based on two dimensions \n The first dimension distinguishes between direct (or absolute) valuation methods and indirect (or relative) valuation methods; the second dimension separates models that rely on cash flows from models that rely on another financial variable, such as sales (revenues), earnings, or book value \n As their name indicates, direct valuation methods provide a direct estimate of a company’s fundamental value \n In the case of public companies, the analyst can then compare the company’s fundamental value obtained from that valuation analysis to the company’s market value \n The company appears fairly valued if its market value is equal to its fundamental value, undervalued if its market value is lower than its fundamental value, and overvalued if its market value is higher than its fundamental value \n In contrast, relative valuation methods do not provide a direct estimate of a company’s fundamental value: They do not indicate whether a company is fairly priced; they indicate only whether it is fairly priced relative to some benchmark or peer group \n Because valuing a company using an indirect valuation method requires identifying a group of comparable companies, this approach to valuation is also called the comparables approach \n End Quote This piece explains thoroughly a set of valuating method and where one can best apply them"},{"msgID":2038,"texte":"My personal preference is limit my

rather, there needs to be a rational argument based on factual premise and thorough analysis against or for a potential course of action \n Another measure that could accompany a bailout is developing something similar to the EPA's Superfund, which was collectively funded by major players in the oil and gas industry in order to allocate government funding for managing environmental liabilities that cannot be funded by the parties responsible \n This fund essentially is a form of government insurance against environmental risks \n Whether such a system has a place in modern banking is debatable \n One final consideration is Hyman Minsky's prediction of boom and bust cycles \n At its most basic level, his theory is that boom and bust cycles are a natural part of the capitalist economy \n In essence, a bust (or burst of a bubble) causes bankers, investors, and governments to behave more rationally and to better account for risks \n In some cases, it is even argued that for a number of years following a bust, stakeholders are overly cautious in their assessments of risk \n However, as the economy begins to prosper, the reign of rationality begins to erode and make way for irrational optimism and speculation \n In aggregate terms, the market reaches a point of instability, in which the previous upward momentum is overpowered by the effects of irrational exuberance, and then collapses as fear takes over and investors lose confidence \n The cycle then repeats itself \n With this consideration in mind, it is possible that history would have repeated itself, in some form or another, regardless of the bailouts - simply due to human nature.\\n\\n To synthesize an answer to the original question based on the above information is not a simple task \n In essence, I think that if the net effect (in net present value terms; NPV) of the bailout was positive, then  by all means, it is a rational course of action \n The first problem comes when determining the actual net benefit based on how this bailout will affect bankers' perception of risk in the future \n This variable is highly unknown and impossible to determine objectively with absolute certainty \n The second problem is perhaps the issue of imposing sanctions or taking punitive action against the key players in the banking industry, whether they were bankers or credit rating agencies \n This again is a difficult question to answer; however, I think it is still important to consider this alternative in NPV terms as to whether it may deter future reckless behaviour \n Again, quantifying this variable would be difficult \n Perhaps an approach that I would find most favourable is an analysis (albeit imperfect) showing the rationale for the decision to impose a bailout (with or without sanctions) and its expected net benefit to the national economy in the long run. Such an analysis should clearly state its assumptions and be open for public scrutiny by academics and (disinterested) professionals \n Although this analysis may not be a perfect representation of reality, it is nonetheless important to attempt to quantify the potential benefits, costs, and risks of any course of action involving such a large sum of money"},{"msgID":3075,"texte":"It was simply necessary"},{"msgID":3076,"texte":"In my opinion depending where you are in your life, what kind of costs you have to face for living and ultimately your Investment profile \n I.E \n A person of 30yrs old would have a small amount of gold in their portfolio while a 50yrs a more expressive participation and of course - giving the cost of opportunity - would choose assets with better Sharpe ratio to their profile"},{"msgID":3077,"texte":"I would have around 10% of my net assets as GOLD to buffer the impact of a negative economic or geo political event"},{"msgID":3078,"texte":"In my opinion the bailoutIt is necessary when the economy goes very badly but in the case of USA is been for many years"},{"msgID":3079,"texte":"As a Brazilian I can say I'm very worried about our central bank policies, mostly because they do not seem to act in order to help the whole economy, but instead to focus on keeping our private banks richer even in crisis time \n However, I consider extremely necessary a powerful Central bank that really cares about the population problems \n So, I feel really bad when I see monetary policies complicating even more the life of those they were supposed to help, the poor and middle class"},{"msgID":3080,"texte":"Say I want to make a P\/E ratio chart of the SPX over the last 3 years against the price of the index, how would I go about this online"},{"msgID":3081,"texte":"We tend to make the assumption that the group as a whole is correctly valued when said valuation may actually be incorrect resulting in a slippery slope of outcomes \n Pop"},{"msgID":3082,"texte":"Well, as I have read from some Macroeconomics textbooks (Dornbush and Fisher, Blanchard, Mankiew et al) and as I have learnt from Macroeconomics Professors, the Fed and central Banks are used to act as Lender of Last Resort since nineteenth century, aimed to avoid financial panic, credit crunch and systemic econimic collapse"},{"msgID":3083,"texte":"Economy is about Profit and Loss \n If a bank, just as a grocery, is not efficient and did not a good work it has to fail; an insurance for users and account holders must exist and sponsored by the bank itself, deposited in the Central Bank \n But if an entity is too big to fail \n There is a clear ethics risk"},{"msgID":3084,"texte":"I think one of the main assumptions with P\/E ratio that can be dangerous is equating earnings to profits \n Just because a firm has high earnings, what were the operating costs and after tax profits \n What kind of debt did that company occur \n There are so many factors beyond P\/E for valuing a company in a healthy manner \n One instance where using P\/E would have been extra dangerous was during the dot-com bubble of 99-01, where companies were trading at 75x P\/E (where today it hovers ~20) \n  There were no sound fundamentals for valuation when looking at actual revenue being produced by these companies, and comparing that to the exorbitantly speculative share prices tech companies were trading at during those times \n Lastly, negative earnings can be overlooked if it is a quarterly loss, or more of an isolated incident that may be die to corporate restructuring, acquisition, etc., and not a recurring incident that has occurred over multiple earnings periods \n Therefore, negative earnings are okay, if not over an extended period of time"},{"msgID":3085,"texte":"Before this lesson I would say that it is not a good idea to put your money in gold but now that I have discovered so many ways of using gold as a hedgde I would invest in gold for my portfolio as an insurance against black swans"},{"msgID":3086,"texte":"I would not hold gold in my portfolio because I would rather hold cash to use during downturn"},{"msgID":3087,"texte":"You must not always use multiples-based valuation methods because market often think wrong about market valuation \n 1 \n Different sectors have different multiples \n In Biotech P\/E can be 20x but in Finance sector P\/E 10x.

a pension plan, executive stock options, continued employment, or professional reputation \n Remove enough of this risk of failure thus increases the odds of greater risk-taking by the bankers (hence the banks) in the future \n Moreover, programs such as TARP penalized good actors in two ways \n First, it kept afloat competitors whose employees had made bad decisions and thus hindered the natural ability of markets to reward those who make good decisions and punish those who make bad decisions \n Bankruptcy is analogous to allowing natural forest fires to periodically clear out the underbrush: if you suppress all forest first, the deadwood and underbrush accumulates and, when a fire inevitably breaks out, it is far more catastrophic \n Second, TARP deliberately forced many sound financial institutions to participate, thus given political cover for helping out failing institutions \n This action helped fuel the popular misconception that all financial institutions were a bunch of greedy

moderate or indeed change any part of their lending practices \n However, lending was never the issue for the so-called Great Recession \n In fact, the depression from which we are still recovering was a result of the lack of segmentation in the Retail and Investment banking arms \n What does this mean \n The Great Depression was caused by massive speculative investment mania by ordinary citizens being allowed to borrow on margin into a roaring bull market where underlying value was detached from price of stocks \n This inevitably led to a bubble or massive proportions and a resulting crash \n However, many banks and lenders were allowed to go to the wall \n Whilst some commentators believe that this was the root cause of the impact and sharp decline in the stock market value, the recovery was also relatively quick lasting approximately 3 years from start to finish \n By contrast, because no banks were allowed to fail other than Lehman Brothers which was used an example of the systemic failure that could occur if other investment banks were allowed to go bust, this allowed the banking leaders (and root cause of the overvaluation of the housing market) to petition for TARP funding from the US government to the tune of $700 million in the first instance and much more subsequently as described in the previous video \n Essentially, the government with the aid of Hank Paulson to justify the massive bail out of private banks with public money \n It is worth remembering that government does not have any money other than through borrowing (bond market) or tax receipts, i.e \n The earnings of private citizens and to a lesser extent companies who tend to offshore their earnings in tax friendly jurisdictions \n So this is what is meant by Moral Hazard \n Nothing other than the inefficient Dodd-Frank bill has been put in place to prevent a repeat of the Great Recession in the next couple of years \n However, the bust this time will be much greater a) because the original debt has not been cleared by allowing banks to go bust and b) because the banks now believe that however they choose to make money they will be back-stopped by the tax payer - privatizing the profits and socializing the losses \n In contrast, the Glass-Steagall act was introduced at the end of the Great Depression to separate Investment and Retail banking arms thereby preventing excessive risk taking by the speculation activity of Investment banks from adversely affecting the 'real economy' i.e \n Business lending and private debt creation \n The last part of this act was repealed by Clinton in 1999 under massive lobbying from the larger banks and this allowed the creation of banking monoliths such as Citigroup (so-called 'Too Big to Fail' institutions)and also the creation of extremely exotic synthetic investment products such as CDO's, securitized mortgages, virtualized securitized mortgage backed securities underwritten by the ratings agencies who were at once employed and expected to be dispassionate about the risk involved in producing these products which no-one actually understood \n The cross-selling and  mixing of these products by investment banks meant that no-one understood exactly what assets belonged to whom, leading to a loss of confidence and so-called Credit Crunch when banks refused to lend to each without exorbitant inter-bank lending rates \n The Central banks were then called upon to act as the lender of last resort which in this instance was the correct approach as the actual situation at the end of 2008 was much more serious than that in 1929 \n This would have been an effective strategy only in so far as it allowed risky assets to be disposed of and bank balance sheets brought under control reducing the leverage from in some cases up to 40:1 down to more historically manageable levels, perhaps around 9:1 \n This unhappily has not happened, and the opportunity has been lost to achieve this aim. This means that the bank balance sheets are in poor shape as they were and consumers are likewise carrying huge burdens of debt \n Growth levels have been weak because of this and in fact despite the lowest interest rates ever recorded, there is little appetite for more debt \n Debt is linked to growth of consumer spending in the US which has a knock-on effect for exporting economies such as the Eurozone which typically does not have the same level of private consumption"},{"msgID":3986,"texte":"I would have a relatively large part of my portfolio invested in Gold (maximum 20%) not only as an

industry, all with the same capital value, same debt and on the same technology level, but this is barely possible, because all the companies even within the one industry are different and each of

about the past performance of a company and about the present situation, but nothing about the future prospects \n There should be a reason why the multiples for the company differ from the average

methods is that the comparable group of companies are correctly valued by market \n In the preceding quiz and lectures as well as evidence in real life confirms that companies may be either undervalued  or overvalued \n If we consider, for example, oil and gas companies in emerging markets such as Russia and Ukraine where the state has almost a monopoly in the industry, the small cap privately owned oil and gas businesses cannot even find a proper peer group for comparison \n The next important requirement for peers comparison is that the relevant group should be consistent in terms of revenue structure, business \"maturity\", debt or simply be alike \n This constitutes another limitation for multiples based methods because  all the companies are different in their own way and normally our knowledge about them is based only on publicly awailable information \n I understand that in this cours we are talking about companies who adhere to the same accounting and reporting standards such as IFRS , US GAAP, or other similar GAAPs (generally accepted accounting principles), while it may not always be the case as each country may have its own standards for financial disclosures \n Hence , the definition of revenue and eventually profit shown by companies in a little known country may also be a subject for discrepancies with the peers in developed markets (countries) \n   The discussed in the course multiples based methods were based on current or past information as opposed to DCF method which takes into consideration future cash inflows and growth rates \n That is in my opinion another disadvantage of multiples methods \n Global demand for some products may change dramatically within industry \n Again in energy sector the price for fossil fuel has dropped from 120 to below 50 usd\/barrel (crude oil Brent) over past few years, the deplition of resources puts under going concern companies producers \n While solar and renewables based energy companies are enjoying stronger growth and future demand (Tesla, Solaris, etc.) \n  Mobile phone companies: Nokia and Blackberry example of failures after years of significant growth couldn't serve as peers to Apple or Samsung (smartphones) while they seemed to be alike \n And finally, the question about p\/e for loss makers \n Well, the purpose of any (commercial) firm is generating profits \n The instinct says investing in loss making companies is a financial suicide \n However if the company is undervalued due to its loss year, it's always worth to ask why there was a loss \n And if the reason was adequate , the investment may be very well rewarded in the future \n It often happens that company underwent some restructuring, was fined by regulator, posted impairment of assets or incurred a loss from discontinued operations \n They not necessary lead to negative EBITDA but significantly lower it \n Financial analysts and accountants call those adverse items as \"one-offs\" \n  One-offs do not typically happen in a due course of business but rather appear as \"black swans\" \n  In this case excluding one - offs from EBITDA or in other words -normalizing EBITDA-  may give us another more accurate picture on the value of the company \n Best regards, Oleksandr"},{"msgID":6004,"texte":"The US government has substantially covered the losses of investment banks since the

negative \n There are three options available to an analyst valuing a firm with negative earnings.\\r\\n • Normalize Earnings: In this approach, we replace the current earnings that are negative with a “normalized earnings” that is positive \n Clearly, this approach pre-supposes that the negative earnings in the current year is an aberration and that the firm will revert back to positive earnings in a normal year.\\rRevenues and Margins: The second approach is to base projections on revenues, which should never be negative, and estimate operating or net margins over time \n As the financial health of the firm improves, the margins should increase from the current levels (which are negative) to a more sustainable positive number \n The projected revenues, in conjunction with the margins, can be used to estimate earnings \n Once earnings turn positive and margins stabilize, valuation becomes more routine \n An alternative and related approach is to estimate capital invested for future years and returns on capital over time, to arrive at estimates of earnings in future periods.\\r\\n • Reduce Leverage: In the special case where a firm reports negative equity earnings because it has too much debt, and not because it has operating problems, the simplest way to adjust earnings over time is to reduce the leverage of the firm \n As the firm operations grow over time, and financing charges are lowered (as leverage is reduced), the equity earnings will become positive.\\r"},{"msgID":6264,"texte":"I think they do \n There should be some form of control or a body that prevents

not. The answer is it depends from aspects you are looking at it \n From the banks' perspective, it was great support \n Bankers took numerous risky bets, created significant risks through expanded use of derivatives and further boosting of those risks with liquidity \n They played with a fire got burned but were lucky to receive an ambulance support that healed the wound and told them it was \"OK\" to play with fire, which in turn would\/could incentivize the bank to play more \n The question comes how long will they be able to play with fire and how long and how often Central Banks could\/would act as lender of last resort \n From the government' perspective, they had to step in otherwise the consequences is that panic and losses would have been taken onto the streets and bloodshed would have followed similar to the Asian financial crisis of 1997 (e.g \n Seoul, Indonesia, Thailand, etc.) \n  Given the intertwinedness of the global markets, chaos in one market and region could have easily escalated and expanded to other regions and markets \n So if a choice between stability and peace (albeit temporarily over the next several years) at a taxpayers' money vs \n Immediate chaos and bloodshed and country destabilization \n Governments would choose the former \n Also one need to keep in mind that central bank roles are for finite period of time, hence, they may have some time limitations \n More of let me take of this issue at hand with all the means there are, and then the consequential spillover effects would be my successor's problem \n Having said, any parties involved (financial institutions, governments, central banks, ordinary citizens) should be worrying about the real cost and prospective consequences of 2007-2008 bailouts \n Governments\/regulations have to take actionable, measurable steps towards reduction of systematic risks, reduction in application and use of derivatives, breaking down large financial institutions in a smaller players that could be

Between 1980 and\\n1995, global capital flows have fluctuated between two and six percent of world\\ngross domestic product (GDP) \n  This sharply grew to 14.8 percent of world GDP by\\n2006 \n Moreover,\\nannual global capital flows tripled between 1995 and 2006 to a total US$7.2\\ntrillion \n The rapid transformation of the financial sector to a key driver in\\nglobalization can basically be traced back to three crucial changes during the\\n1960s and 1970s \n Firstly,\\nthe emergence of a Eurocurrency market in the 1960s, in which the first\\ninternational financial system was developed in which banks were dealing in\\nforeign currency \n The system supported cross-border transactions and avoided\\ndomestic regulations for Transnational Corporations (TNCs) due the fact they\\ndeposited their surplus funds in foreign currency, thus increasing the need for\\nfinancial service activity \n This has slowly softened under the Bretton Woods\\nSystem (BWS), which was established to return security to national economic\\nmarkets after years of high insecurity and low worldwide trade and investment\\nduring the two World Wars \n The\\nBWS collapsed in 1973 when President Nixon questioned the pegging of the dollar\\nto the gold reserves \n Secondly, declining international confidence in the US\\ndollar established a system where currency exchange rates were determined by\\ntheir value on the global market \n This established a foreign currency trading\\nmarket, which is the largest financial market in the world \n Currencies can be\\nsimultaneously traded in a 24-hours market completely electronically.\\nTherefore, thirdly, new technological innovations became a catalyst in the\\nemergence of the huge electronic financial transactions that have contributed\\nto the staggering evolution of the financial industry \n The annual turnover in\\nforeign exchange was US$17.5 trillion in 1979, increasing to a daily level of\\nUS$3.5 trillion or US$1,277.5 trillion annually in 2007 \n One\\nadditional aspect was crucial in the globalization process and rise of the\\nfinancial sector \n When the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)\\nquadrupled the price of oil, most banks were faced by a dramatic surplus of\\ncapital flows \n Moreover, nations became more dependent on banking institutions\\nwhen OPEC members decided to channel the majority of their earnings ―through\\nthe transnational banks \n Within four years, between 1976 and 1980, the major\\ninternational banks experienced a staggering increase of 95 percent in their\\naggregated assets \n The capital accumulation of international banks also made\\nthem increasingly become lending institutions to countries, which made these\\ncountries increasingly dependent on these financial institutions - a key reason\\nfor growing national financial deregulation \n Facilitated\\nby global improvements in communication infrastructure and deregulation of\\ndomestic financial markets, securitization of debts into marketable instruments\\ncontributed to competition and vast expansion of the financial market \n Banks\\nsecuritized formerly illiquid ‘assets‘, such as a mortgage loans into ‘new‘\\nfinancial products, which could be traded on the stock market \n TNCs increased\\ncapitalization by issuing equities \n Additionally, nation states participated in\\nthe financial market by issuing bonds to increase liquidity for themselves.\\nAnother ‘innovative‘ financial product concerns the emergence of a secondary\\nmortgage market in the United States (U.S.) \n  Formerly illiquid debts became\\ntransformed into liquid and tradable mortgage-backed securities that were\\ntraded on the stock exchange \n In particular with domestic financial\\nliberalization in the early 1990s, individuals and institutional investors\\nsignificantly contributed to an internationalization of financial market\\nactivities by the purchase of equities, shares and bonds \n The volume of\\ninternational equity issued in 1986 was at US$32 billion \n In 1999 it rose to\\nthe staggering amount of US$28 trillion \n Real estate\\ndevelopment and globalization  The\\ntransformation of the urban built environment reflects the global-local\\ninterplay of globalisation forces \n [ \n ] \n  The real estate sector is also\\nan investment form, which boosts through speculation the artificial production\\nof the building stock in globalising cities \n There\\nare three main developments, which have contributed to the emergence of a\\nglobal real estate market \n First,\\nthe global economy‘s shift towards banking and producer service activities\\ndramatically increased the demand for offices \n [ \n ] \n  Since the 1980s, that has led to the construction of\\nmillions of sq m of new office space \n ―The rapid building of one high-rise office\\ncomplex after another has transformed cities all across the world \n Secondly,\\nthere was an internationalisation of the office market by its developers, users\\nand owners \n [ \n ] \n  Increasing prices and growing demand for\\noffice development produced record profits and attracted domestic and foreign\\ninvestors \n Panreiter emphasises that major cities, in particular those that\\nhave dynamic developments in advanced producer services, also correspond high\\non cross-border real estate investment \n Part of these increasing cross-border\\nreal estate transactions are based on the fact that the financial sector are\\nusers and buyers of the commercial properties \n [ \n ] \n   Understanding\\nthat real estate development is a very capital-intensive economic sector, real\\nestate construction provided an ideal investment asset for the financial\\nindustry \n Real estate can act as securities and collateral for bank lending \n In\\nfact, this shows that office markets in globalising cities are linked in an\\ninternational real estate and capital market \n [ \n ] \n   Thirdly,\\nnew types of institutional investment by the end of the 1970s in form of\\npension funds and insurance companies increased global real estate activities.\\nConsiderable growth rates in the service sector, which promised constantly\\nincreasing profits and the search for new long-term investment opportunities,\\nwere major driving forces of institutional expansion \n [ \n ] \n  A\\nkey aspect for the emergence of a global real estate market is the financial\\nliberalisation [ \n ] \n  In\\nparticular, the securitisation of former fixed real estate assets into stocks\\nand securities through real estate investment trusts (REITs) increased\\nliquidity, transparency and capital volume for national and international\\nproperty development \n [ \n ] \n  Predominantly\\nthe securitisation of real estate from a fixed asset into a liquid and tradable\\ncommodity enhanced global real estate market activities \n A study by Jones Lang\\nLaSalle in 2008 showed that the volume in direct commercial property investment\\nhas more than doubled from US$354 billion in 2003 to US$759 billion in 2007.\\nCross-border transactions have been also constantly growing \n In 2003, worldwide\\ncross-border commercial property transaction accounted for US$90 billion \n That\\nvolume grew to a staggering amount of US$353 billion in 2007 \n The promising\\nyears of economic development between 2000 and 2007 also provided Asia-Pacific\\nwith impressive economic growth rates \n Cross-border transactions on commercial\\nproperty accounted for 32 percent in 2006, and rapidly grew one year later to a\\nremarkable 47 percent of all commercial property transactions in the region \n [ \n ] \n  Other\\nfactors also increased real estate activities and their globalization \n The\\nglobal expansion of TNCs increased not just the demand for commercial real\\nestate, but also the demand for residential property development, driven by a\\ngrowing mobile expatriate population worldwide \n The number of worldwide\\nmigrants almost doubled from 136 million in 1990 to 210 million in 2010 \n Stimulating\\nurban growth through housing and office construction has also successfully\\nimpacted countries economic development by understanding how other supporting\\nservices such as financing; architecture, consultancy, management and material\\nproduction are involved in real estate production \n [ \n ]"},{"msgID":7407,"texte":"Not more than 5%"},{"msgID":7408,"texte":"I think the lessons meant ti prepare us for the quiz have to be more carefully prepared and

Gfcf ) ) x FcFn This means that for your terminal value you divide your growth factor (5% in my case, so 1.05) by your discount rate minus your growth factor (so in my case 9 %- 5% = 0.04) \n  In our case this is:   1.05\/0.04 = 26.25 \n And then you apply that number times the cash flow of the last year \n That means, 0.86 million x 26.25 = 22.6 million  Total value:  3.65 mil + 22.6 mil = 26.25 mil  Note: I hope I made no mistakes \n It may be wise to figure out what discount rates are, free cash flows, etc. I hope this helped, let me know if you have questions"},{"msgID":7440,"texte":"I have just tried the new offering, and although I have got 5\/6 on graded quiz on the very first attempt, and the system expects you to get the perfect score to pass -

Gfcf ) ) x FcFn This means that for your terminal value you divide your growth factor (5% in my case, so 1.05) by your discount rate minus your growth factor (so in my case 9 %- 5% = 0.04) \n  In our case this is:   1.05\/0.04 = 26.25 \n And then you apply that number times the cash flow of the last year \n That means, 0.86 million x 26.25 = 22.6 million  Total value:  3.65 mil + 22.6 mil = 26.25 mil  Note: I hope I made no mistakes \n It may be wise to figure out what discount rates are, free cash flows, etc. I hope this helped, let me know if you have questions"},{"msgID":7528,"texte":"The purpose of duration: The most important metric to mesure the price sensitivity  of a bond due to interest rates variation over the years \n What are we measruing: The equilibrium point in time, of the  NPVs of all the cash flows \n It means that the sum of present value of the cash flows prior to the duration point is equal the sum of present values of cash flows after the duration point \n That part is merely technical \n Why is it important \n Once you buy a bond, it can be translated to a cash flow scheme, therefore you can measure the value of that bond \n You measure that value using a given interest rate \n (which will be the same during all the years until the maturity) \n  So, it's important to know that the value of your bond will never change \n The amount of money that you will recieve in each coupon and the principal will never change \n But what about it's value in the market, in other words, what about it's price \n Let's assume that yesteray you bought a government bond with the following conditions:   Price: $1000    Interest rate: 10%   Maturity: 10 years \n Coupons issued at the end of each year \n Then, today the government raised the interest rate from 10% to 20% \n  Obiviously, the same $1000 is going to be much more proftable now, right \n And also today, you need some money and decided to sell the bond you bought yesterday \n Nobody is going to buy it for $1000, they prefer buy direct from the government \n So, for how much are you going to sell \n You can make that calculation very easily using the duration metric, like we saw on the video"},{"msgID":7529,"texte":"30 percent"},{"msgID":7530,"texte":"I thought I asked this but I can't seem to find it, so apologies if it's posted twice but where did you get 134 from"},{"msgID":7531,"texte":"I think that 10 percent is the upper limit because I consider gold as an insurance policy, and no worthwhile insurance policy should be 20 percent of the money you have invested"},{"msgID":7532,"texte":"1 \n Equivalent financing 2, High interest rate environment 3 \n Can not apple P\/E if a loss"},{"msgID":7533,"texte":"I don't mean to anticipate anything, but if you look at the comparison of the 2 stocks A&B (part1) and their monthly returns over three months, we can see a trend which is upward for stock A even if the average of the three months is lower \n Should not we be spotting the trends too?\\n"},{"msgID":7534,"texte":"There is formula given for the terminal value V(N) \n  But I am unable to get 1742 when I use it \n I.e., V(n)={(1+4%)\/(12%-4%)} x 134.

I understand the basic point: when you lose on a long bet, you own less of the stock, when you lose on a short bet you own more \n This seems obvious by the very nature of the bets \n However, what I am having trouble with is how he determines what portion of your portfolio the short bet actually is \n What I am wondering is the net value of a short is zero initially:  you borrow 100 for a stock (-100), and immediately sell it (+100) and place the money with the bank as collateral so net impact to your investments is zero \n This assumes you are one of the lucky few that the bank would actally do this for!  So for a portfolio of 1000 dollars, he seemed to be calculating that this net zero made up 10% \n   And he only put out 900 to make up the portfolio \n In the other case, he had to invest 1000 \n So the example seems like comparing apples to oranges in some sense \n When I initially answered the question, I stated that the relative position in the first portfolio decreased by assuming that we made 8.88% on the 900 (+80)  portion, and lost 80% on the 100 (-80) for a end value of 980+20 = 1000 with the 10% decreasing to 2% \n   For the second one it is not so straight forward if you think about it \n We invested 1000 in the first portfolio (I assume real cash) in the second we only put 900 real cash, and have a 100 loan for the short \n If the short increases by 20% and our 900 investment increases by 2.22% (20 dollars) then we can take the 20 dollars and pay for the margin call and still have net value of 1000 (although total value of 1020) \n   In this case, one could consider that the net outlay for the short is still 100 and for the other part is 900 - so the relative portions do not change \n Or you could consider the total value of 1020 and compare to 120 which gives an 11.7% increase \n I'm sure he did not mean for us to think this hard about it - but a \"real world\" apples to apples comparison would have been more useful in my opinion \n And this leaves me with the question - how do you compute the actual value of a short in your portfolio"},{"msgID":7708,"texte":"I think that the investor should dinamecly run his portfolio and partly buy and sell gold depending on the market stage \n Crisis periods 20% of his portfolio, stagnation 5-10%, slight rise 5%, rise 5%"},{"msgID":7709,"texte":"Hello Long, Can you help me with the outcome of questions 3 and 5 of the second week Quiz, please \n I have difficulties to solve them \n Thank you.

Thus, the weight of this short position in the final cash from liquidation of the portfolio will be lower and not higher as you mentioned in the example \n So, from my point of view, in your example, the value of the short portfolio is artificially increased by $40, since it seems for an investor, that portfolio is worth $1000, but when she tries to liquidate it, it will worth only $960.

That already tells us that gold should be at a minimum of 30% \n  There is no point to weigh by probability of black swans here, because the definition of \"iron reserve\" is that under any circumstances can it be risked \n Let's make two further assumptions: (a) the observed historic rate of return of non-gold portfolio is 10% and (b) in case of a black swan we lose 75% of our capital invested in non-gold assets \n So now we have 70,000 USD remaining risk capital \n If we include another 10,000 USD in gold out of that risk capital we are losing the upside opportunity, which is equal to the share of gold out of the risk money X the observed historic return in other investments, i.e.:   Share of gold out of risk capital = 10 \/ 70 = 14%\\n   Historic return of portfolio ex \n Gold = 10%\\n   Then the opportunity cost of this 10K invested in gold is 1.4pp negative of the final return\\n   This opportunity cost would increase as we increase the share of gold, e.g \n If we invest everything in gold, the opportunity cost would be equal to 100%x10% = 10pp negative - what we would have made if we invested everything in non-gold portfolio \n (The opportunity cost for the initial 30,000 USD iron reserve allocation is 0% because it is not really an option to invest it, therefore nothing to lose by holding it.) If for a moment we assume that black swan cannot happen, increasing the gold position to about 45K (on top of the initial 30k) we will get 0% return precisely because of the opportunity cost, therefore gold should not exceed that dollar amount \n On the other extreme if we want to maximize our returns we should invest all 70,000 in non-gold assets \n Three final considerations:   If we believe that the probability of a black swan is above ~13% (the cut off point using the assumptions above) we should not invest in the stock market at all, as the probability-weighted loss from a black swan will wipe out the probability-weighted investment returns.\\n   The percentage share of gold in our portfolio also depends on the size of the entire portfolio, e.g \n If we have $500,000 capital to invest and iron reserve requirement of $50,000 this gives us minimum gold requirement of 10% (unlike the 30% in the first example) \n    We may argue that in a black swan scenario we will not lose everything (e.g \n We will save 25% of 70,000 = 17,500) and therefore our iron reserve should be 30 - 17.5 = 12.5, but that really depends on the interpretation of 'iron' in iron reserve and 'black' in black swan \n \\n"},{"msgID":8161,"texte":"Long term  Equities appear to offer better returns , so you should be 100% vested in Equities, however my own risk tolerance would be concerned with short term volatility for the more extreme market moves (greater than 10%)  \n  As protection I would look to have Gold as an insurance on my overall assets, representing  say 10 - 12.5% of overall Portfolio"},{"msgID":8162,"texte":"I have reconsidered this question – for a\\nretired person - and would propose that instead of basing the amount of gold on\\na %, one could calculate the amount based on the annual income needed after the\\nBlack Swan disaster \n Based on the following assumptions: ·     \\nthe entire portfolio is lost\\nwith the exception of the gold; ·     \\nI need enough income to cover\\nthe remaining years of my life; ·     \\nI need an income of I per year; ·     \\nI live to be 100 years;  ·     \\nMy present age is A; and ·     \\nGold (G) will appreciate by a\\nfactor of 4 when the Black Swan event occurs \n I arrive at the following (ball park)\\nestimate:                                G = ((100- A)* I)\/4"},{"msgID":8163,"texte":"Christina, I can see that you have already mentioned the correct answer in your comment \n All is takes is round the number to its nearest integer when it is larger than half \n For example: 600.12= 600 600.68=601  I hope that's helpful"},{"msgID":8164,"texte":"Dave I agree, the metrics for ITUB show attractive numbers for a value investor buy.\\n I think that we may have to be a bit cautious on the historical prices of ITUB in US$, there was a big devaluation of the R$ (Brazilian Real in the last 12 months) \n    ITAU earnings are mostly in R$ \n  Even though I make no bet nor any forecast on currencies, I think that the level of echange rate for the R$ is more realistic now than for the past years \n I do not expect further significant devaluation despite the volatility \n I think that we probably we'll see the R$ in the band from 3.9 to 4.5 in the next 12 months \n Below is the graphics of ITUB in R$ during the last 5 years \n In R$, the price is roughly flat, but the earnings of the bank increased dramatically \n If you want  to get the numbers in R$, you can check \"ITUB4 \n SA\" in Yahoo Finance"},{"msgID":8165,"texte":"15 to 20%"},{"msgID":8166,"texte":"I manually did the math for both examples and things didn't quite add up \n Here's what I got, rounded to two (2) decimal places \n What am I doing wrong \n On Excel, the answers were correct \n Ex.1 NPV = -150 + 20\/1.10 + 50\/1.10 + 70\/1.10 + 70\/1.10 NPV = -150 + 18.18 + 45.45 + 63.64 + 63.64 NPV = 40.91 Ex \n 2 NPV = 100 - 90\/1.10 + 20\/1.10 - 90\/1.10 +40\/1.10 NPV = 100 - 81.82 + 18.18 - 81.82 + 36.36 NPV = 9.10"},{"msgID":8167,"texte":"Maybe 10%"},{"msgID":8168,"texte":"I think it was necessary back in 2008-2010, but should have been reined in the years 2012-2018"},{"msgID":8169,"texte":"5% only"},{"msgID":8170,"texte":"Hi Shankar, I'm working on adding question for the second part of Week 2 to cover fixed income as well \n When your find, say, 200,000,000$ as an answer and you are asked to give it in million USD, then you should write \"200\" \n  I hope this helps \n Best regards, Jonas"},{"msgID":8171,"texte":"Hello Vincent, Can you help me with the outcome of questions 3 and 5 of the second week Quiz, please \n I have difficulties to solve them \n Thank you.
